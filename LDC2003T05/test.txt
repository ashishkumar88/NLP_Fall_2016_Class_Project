The United States has contacted three Arab countries  in an effort to help broker a ceasefire between rival leaders in the Yemen  civil war, an Egyptian diplomat said Wednesday.
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were contacted  because they "are the three Arab countries best placed" to ensure "an indirect  dialogue between the northen and southern Yemenis," the diplomat said.
The three have already urged the warring sides to lay down arms and start  talks to end the civil war which broke out on May 5.
The aim of the US-led mediation was to "preserve Yemen's unity without  resorting to force," the diplomat added.
He hinted that northern troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh would  be called upon to accept a ceasefire in exchange for the south giving up its  unilateral declaration of independence.
"There is still a chance of ending the fighting in Yemen," he said.
US charge d'affairs Edmund Hull told reporters following talks with  Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa, for the second time within 24 hours, that  Egypt and the United States were working "to obtain a ceasefire in Yemen and  facilitate the opening of talks between the two protaganists."
A US diplomatic source said Mussa and Hull discussed "practical steps to  end the fighting and encourage political dialogue" as the war was about to  enter its fourth week.
He said the United States was "very concerned by the situation in Yemen."
Southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid on Saturday proclaimed a new independent  state called the Yemeni Democratic Republic to end a four-year troubled union  between the former conservative, tribal North and the Marxist South.
The south's declaration of independence has been denounced by Washington,  while Egypt has stressed that Yemen's unity cannot be maintained by force.
The new republic has not been recognised by any country so far, apart from  the breakaway region of Somaliland in Africa.
But the UAE implictly recognised it by referring to Baid as "the  president."

Canadian residents bought foreign securities worth  some 1.8 billion dollars (1.3 billion US) in March, double the amount of  Canadian securities bought by foreigners, the government reported Wednesday.
Statistics Canada said the March purchase of foreign stocks and bonds by  Canadians was due primarily to Canadian mutual fund industry stepping up its  "heavy investment in foreign stocks" with non-North American equity funds  proving popular.
The March figures bring the average monthly investment by Canadians in  foreign securities since November to 1.6 billion dollars (1.16 billion US).
In February, just 700 million dollars (507 million US) worth of foreign  securities were purchased by Canadian residents.
The 900 million dollars (652 million US) worth of Canadian securities  purchased by non-residents contrasted sharply with the average monthly figure  of 4.1 billion dollars (2.97 billion US) in January and February.
One of the main reasons for this decline, according to Statistics Canada,  was a drop in foreign purchases of Canadian stocks in March -- just 700  million dollars (507 million US), marking the first time since November that  this figure had fallen below a billion dollars (725 million US).

Russia is heading for massive participation in an  east-west programme of military partnership despite differences with NATO over  political relations, diplomats and officials said here Wednesday.
They were speaking after Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev called for  a formal new system of consultations between Moscow and the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation on European and world security.
But Grachev stressed that Russia was not insisting on the consultations as  a condition for joining in the partnership for peace (PFP) programme of  military cooperation between NATO and countries of the former Soviet empire.
And a senior NATO source said the Atlantic alliance was willing to go some  way to strengthening consultations with Moscow outside the PFP as a way of  coaxing Russia into the partnership.
Compromise was evident Wednesday as Grachev presented Russia's proposals  on military and political links at a meeting of defence ministers from NATO  and countries of the former Soviet bloc, plus Finland, Slovenia and Sweden.
"We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in the PFP, but  Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the NATO source said.
NATO sees the PFP as a web of military cooperation between former Cold War  adversaries aimed at preventing conflict. Russia in the past has shown more  interest in having a political relationship with NATO.
Grachev presented Russia's response to the PFP programme. It indicated  interest in a strong level of involvement including military training and  exercises, plus peace-keeping and search-and-rescue missions.
But it also reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic meetings  with NATO on security issues -- and at all political and military levels. NATO  is resisting such a formal commitment.
Grachev also urged that responsibility for European security should be  taken away from the US-dominated NATO towards the pan-European Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) where US influence is diluted.
This is an old Russian position which is routinely rejected by NATO.
But diplomats said there was greater sympathy in Brussels for the idea of  more frequent security dialogue between NATO and Russia -- particularly in  areas not dealt with in the PFP such as nuclear arms control.
This could include controls on the spread of nuclear weapons, the  dismantling of weapons and the conversion of Russian weapons factories for  civilian use -- goals supported by Russia and NATO.
However, German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said Russia could have no  automatic right of consultation about NATO decisions, and no right of veto. It  would not be able to stop a former satellite such as Poland joining NATO.
And, with an eye to calming eastern European suspicion of Russian motives,  he said all NATO-Russian consultations would be "transparent" -- their details  available to other PFP countries.
In his presentation here Wednesday, Grachev also pledged that Russia would  send no troops into the "near abroad" -- other countries of the former Soviet  Union -- without the consent of all parties there.
He said Western troops and officers would be welcome to participate in  peacekeeping operations in such countries as Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan  adding that such help would be a "relief" to the Russian military.
