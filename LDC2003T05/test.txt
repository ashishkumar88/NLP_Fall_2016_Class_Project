Tributes poured in from around the world Thursday  to the late Labour Party leader John Smith, who died earlier from a massive  heart attack aged 55.
In Washington, the US State Department issued a statement regretting "the  untimely death" of the rapier-tongued Scottish barrister and parliamentarian.
"Mr. Smith, throughout his distinguished career in government and in  opposition, left a profound impression on the history of his party and his  country," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said.
"Secretary (of State Warren) Christopher extends his deepest condolences  to Mrs. Smith and to the Smith children."
In Bonn, the head of the German Social Democratic Party, Rudolf Scharping,  said in a statement he was "very affected by the sudden death of John Smith.
"A good friend of German social democracy has left us too early. He was  very close to achieving his life's goal of making the Labour Party the largest  political force in Britain" and would be "cruelly missed" in Europe, he said.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, a former Conservative Party chairman,  offered his condolences to the Smith family and said his former politcal  opponent was a "good and decent man, widely respected."
In France, French President Francois Mitterrand sent a message of  condolences to Smith's widow Elizabeth and to Labour Party general-secretary  Larry Whitty.
The head of the French Socialist Party Michel Rocard told French radio  Thursday he was "shocked and stunned" by Smith's death:
Rocard had spent Wednesday evening with Smith and his wife after attending  the launch in London of the Labour Party campaign for the European elections.
"He was in great shape last night, and this came as a shock to me," Rocard  said. "John Smith was a fervant European. He fought for a Great Britain that  would have a leading role in the building of Europe."
In Brussels, European Commission President Jacques Delors, a French  socialist, said Smith was "a friend and companion in the struggle for justice  and solidarity."
He would be "sorely missed by all who are striving for progress and, in  particular, by all true Europeans."
The Party of European Socialists also expressed its sorrow. Party  president, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, said: "Scotland and Britain  have lost a great man, Europe has lost a great ally and the socialist family  has lost a great leader.
"We have lost not just a great friend but a convinced and convincing  European whose ideals and work sprang from deeply-held moral convictions and  sense of justice."
In Lisbon, Portuguese Socialist Party general secretary Antonio Guterres  sent a message of condolences to Smith's widow.
In London, the Socialist International, expressed its "profound sadness"  in a letter signed by president Pierre Mauroy, a former French Socialist  premier, and general secretary Luis Ayale. Smith was the group's deputy  president.

France would not join a US military invasion of  Haiti as part of an effort to restore democratic rule, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said Thursday.
Juppe, in Washington for talks with US officials, said he told US  President Bill Clinton that Paris had ruled out participation in such an  invasion force, which has been suggested as an option by Clinton and urged by  some members of Congress.
"I confirmed that military intervention to kick out the military  leadership is out of the question for us," Juppe told reporters in Washington.
The French diplomat meanwhile reiterated his condemnation of the military  regime in Port-au-Prince and the naming Wednesday of interim president Emile  Jonassaint, whom Juppe described as a "puppet with no legitimacy."
He said France was working to enforce the latest UN Security Council  resolution calling for stiffer sanctions if the military refuses to leave  power and restore democracy by May 21.
France also was prepared to participate in a UN multinational force to  help train a new Haitian police force once democracy is restored, Juppe noted.
Juppe said such a force was in the process of being sent to Haiti last  October before the collapse of an agreement to restore exiled president  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In an implicit criticism of US handling of the matter, Juppe said,  "Unfortunately the boat (with US and Canadian troops) turned back because  there were a few people making noise on the port."

Chinese dissidents in the United States  generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing's privileged trading status  targeting state-owned firms, not complete revocation, dissident leaders said  here Thursday.
There are differing views among the dissident community in the United  States on the best way to advance human rights in China, but "an overwhelming  majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted revocation," Zhao Haiching,  the president of the National Council for Chinese Affairs (NCCA) told a press  conference.
China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human  rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if he were  to extend Beijing's most favored nation (MFN) trading status beyond June 3,  Zhao said.
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the  government's intransigence, said Zhao, whose group coordinates dissident  groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China.
Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned  enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its human  rights record, while not punishing the private sector and market economy which  everybody wants to promote, Zhao said.
Zhao also said it was the United States's own fault that its decision to  firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit.
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China "that all they have to  do to win MFN is play tough, and they have been doing so," Zhao said.
Economic officials in the government made it clear early that revoking  human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States.
Chinese dissident Wang Juntao, jailed for his part in the 1989  pro-democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square massacre, is  in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US officials.
Wang said that his release was a miracle, but urged the international  community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in China.
Wang was to meet with Clinton's national security advisor Anthony Lake  Thursdsay and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord Friday.
