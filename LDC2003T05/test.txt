Tributes poured in from around the world Thursday  to the late Labour Party leader John Smith, who died earlier from a massive  heart attack aged 55.
In Washington, the US State Department issued a statement regretting "the  untimely death" of the rapier-tongued Scottish barrister and parliamentarian.
"Mr. Smith, throughout his distinguished career in government and in  opposition, left a profound impression on the history of his party and his  country," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said.
"Secretary (of State Warren) Christopher extends his deepest condolences  to Mrs. Smith and to the Smith children."
In Bonn, the head of the German Social Democratic Party, Rudolf Scharping,  said in a statement he was "very affected by the sudden death of John Smith.
"A good friend of German social democracy has left us too early. He was  very close to achieving his life's goal of making the Labour Party the largest  political force in Britain" and would be "cruelly missed" in Europe, he said.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, a former Conservative Party chairman,  offered his condolences to the Smith family and said his former politcal  opponent was a "good and decent man, widely respected."
In France, French President Francois Mitterrand sent a message of  condolences to Smith's widow Elizabeth and to Labour Party general-secretary  Larry Whitty.
The head of the French Socialist Party Michel Rocard told French radio  Thursday he was "shocked and stunned" by Smith's death:
Rocard had spent Wednesday evening with Smith and his wife after attending  the launch in London of the Labour Party campaign for the European elections.
"He was in great shape last night, and this came as a shock to me," Rocard  said. "John Smith was a fervant European. He fought for a Great Britain that  would have a leading role in the building of Europe."
In Brussels, European Commission President Jacques Delors, a French  socialist, said Smith was "a friend and companion in the struggle for justice  and solidarity."
He would be "sorely missed by all who are striving for progress and, in  particular, by all true Europeans."
The Party of European Socialists also expressed its sorrow. Party  president, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, said: "Scotland and Britain  have lost a great man, Europe has lost a great ally and the socialist family  has lost a great leader.
"We have lost not just a great friend but a convinced and convincing  European whose ideals and work sprang from deeply-held moral convictions and  sense of justice."
In Lisbon, Portuguese Socialist Party general secretary Antonio Guterres  sent a message of condolences to Smith's widow.
In London, the Socialist International, expressed its "profound sadness"  in a letter signed by president Pierre Mauroy, a former French Socialist  premier, and general secretary Luis Ayale. Smith was the group's deputy  president.

France would not join a US military invasion of  Haiti as part of an effort to restore democratic rule, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said Thursday.
Juppe, in Washington for talks with US officials, said he told US  President Bill Clinton that Paris had ruled out participation in such an  invasion force, which has been suggested as an option by Clinton and urged by  some members of Congress.
"I confirmed that military intervention to kick out the military  leadership is out of the question for us," Juppe told reporters in Washington.
The French diplomat meanwhile reiterated his condemnation of the military  regime in Port-au-Prince and the naming Wednesday of interim president Emile  Jonassaint, whom Juppe described as a "puppet with no legitimacy."
He said France was working to enforce the latest UN Security Council  resolution calling for stiffer sanctions if the military refuses to leave  power and restore democracy by May 21.
France also was prepared to participate in a UN multinational force to  help train a new Haitian police force once democracy is restored, Juppe noted.
Juppe said such a force was in the process of being sent to Haiti last  October before the collapse of an agreement to restore exiled president  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In an implicit criticism of US handling of the matter, Juppe said,  "Unfortunately the boat (with US and Canadian troops) turned back because  there were a few people making noise on the port."

Chinese dissidents in the United States  generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing's privileged trading status  targeting state-owned firms, not complete revocation, dissident leaders said  here Thursday.
There are differing views among the dissident community in the United  States on the best way to advance human rights in China, but "an overwhelming  majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted revocation," Zhao Haiching,  the president of the National Council for Chinese Affairs (NCCA) told a press  conference.
China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human  rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if he were  to extend Beijing's most favored nation (MFN) trading status beyond June 3,  Zhao said.
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the  government's intransigence, said Zhao, whose group coordinates dissident  groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China.
Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned  enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its human  rights record, while not punishing the private sector and market economy which  everybody wants to promote, Zhao said.
Zhao also said it was the United States's own fault that its decision to  firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit.
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China "that all they have to  do to win MFN is play tough, and they have been doing so," Zhao said.
Economic officials in the government made it clear early that revoking  human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States.
Chinese dissident Wang Juntao, jailed for his part in the 1989  pro-democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square massacre, is  in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US officials.
Wang said that his release was a miracle, but urged the international  community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in China.
Wang was to meet with Clinton's national security advisor Anthony Lake  Thursdsay and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord Friday.

The Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno Karabakh was  torn by further fighting Thursday as unconfirmed reports of a possible new  ceasefire circulated.
Russian foreign ministry sources said a ceasefire accord was agreed  Wednesday between the Azeri and Armenian defence ministers as well as  pro-Armenian separatist forces fighting to prise the enclave from Azeri  administration.
The area has a largely Armenian population but falls within Azerbajian.
The accord was due to have come into effect overnight but a spokesman for  the Armenian rebels in the province told AFP there had been merely a  photocopied exchange of propositions Wednesday on a possible laying down of  arms.
Armenia's defence minister meanwhile told AFP that Yerevan was in no way  party to a decision.
Karabakh troops accused Azerbaijan of launching an attack Thursday on the  back of intensive artillery bombardments around Agdam, just beyond the eastern  edge of the disputed enclave and now under Armenian control.
ITAR-TASS quoted the Azeri minister of defence as saying Baku's forces had  for more than 24 hours been engaged in clashes with the aim of retaking two  villages in northern Karabakh.
A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry called on the warring parties  to "respect scrupulously" the reported ceasefire agreement but also questioned  the willingness of their political masters to seek a peaceful solution.
Many earlier ceasefire accords have been broken in the conflict which has  claimed more than 20,000 lives since fighting broke out in February 1988.
Peace talks chaired by the inter-parliamentary assembly of the  Commonwealth of Independent States failed last week in Kirghizstan.

This time, Nigel Mansell will not be  left behind on a restart.
The English racer's bid for victory here last year in his first  Indianapolis 500 was foiled when eventual winner Emerson Fittpaldi and  runner-up Arie Luyendyk passed him when a mid-race caution period ended.
That was how Mansell learned passing was allowed on the 2.5-mile (4k) oval  here as soon as the green flag waves, not at the start-finish line.
"The restart was a painful lesson regarding the rules of the race track,"  Mansell said. "There are some different rules here. Now I know about them. I  wasn't as prepared as I will be this year."
The reigning Indy-car series champion will be among top contenders in  Saturday's battle for pole position in the 78th Indy 500. Time trials for the  May 29 race continue the next two weekends.
"I'm optimistic, yes, but confident, no," Mansell said. "It's going to be  a tough weekend. This track stands alone as king of the circuits. It carries a  lot more excitement for the driver. It's incredibly demanding here."
Mansell's Cosworth-powered Lola has a top speed of 227.969 mph (364.750  k/hr) during this week's practice sessions. That ranks fifth for the week  behind Brazilian's Fittipaldi and Raul Boesel, Canada's Paul Tracy and  Mansell's teammate, Mario Andretti.
"I'm pleased with my speeds," Mansell said. "We will work on the car and  try to go a little quicker yet. When I came back here the first day I was  probably a one. Now I'm maybe a six on a learning scale. I'll be up to nine or  10 by Saturday. But it takes time."
---
Mansell went on to five Indy-car triumphs and the series title last  season, but well remembers the one that got away.
"Last year I made some mistakes here and I'm not going to make any excuses  why they happened," Mansell said. "The strategy will be very much the same.  This time I'm more comfortable and aware of a lot more situations. I will try  to make sure I'm in good shape and get the first 400 miles out of the way,  then you really have to start charging and racing and go for it."
Mansell's Indy rookie of the year performance made most people forget he  ws injured just a month earlier in a crash at Phoenix in his first oval  effort.
"This year I can walk and it's so much better," Mansell said. "I have a  comfort level mentally and physically. After the accident on the first oval, a  lot of people said, 'I told you so.' To have the dogged determination to come  back and do well on the ovals showed a lot of people."
Despite four oval triumphs last year, Mansell does not feel he has the  circuits mastered.
"I'm still learning about the ovals," he said. "I haven't adapted really.  Oval racing is pure racing and I have always thought of myself as a racer. You  get in traffic and you have dogfights and I forget I'm on an oval."
Mansell has not forgotten what the ovals have meant to him, however.
"Winning the Indy-car championship had more impact than winning the  Formula One championship," he said. "I was runner-up three times basically  from 1986, so when we eventually did win Formula One, everyone was so  relieved. Winning here, everybody was more shocked and surprised."

Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Terek Aziz  lobbied UN members in New York Thursday to lift the oil embargo against his  country.
Next week the Security Council is to review the sanctions imposed against  Baghdad following the invasion of Kuwait, and western diplomats are predicting  that the four-year-old embargo will remain in force.
Aziz said the council should acknowledge that Iraq has complied with UN  resolutions and that conditions for lifting the sanctions have been met.
Some members of the council refuse to recognize the progress Baghdad has  made toward meeting the UN demands, Aziz said following a meeting with  Nigeria's Ibrahim Gambari, who holds the council's rotating presidency.
Iraq is particularly keen on getting rid of the oil embargo in return for  its agreement to meet UN disarmament requirements and has argued that the  allied nations had not kept up their end of the bargain.
Aziz said the United States and Britain should "decide if they are in  compliance with the resolutions they themselves voted or are using those  resolutions to reach special, unilateral, political objectives."
The vice-prime minister is to meet with several Security Council members  before Tuesday's session to review the embargo as well as with the head of the  UN commission to oversee Iraq's disarmament, Rolf Ekeus.
The commission is currently working on a system for monitoring Iraq's  weapons capabilities long-term which diplomats said could be operational by  July.
A six-month probationary period would be required before the commission  could verify Baghdad's compliance with all the conditions to the Security  Council, which would then consider lifting the sanctions, sources said.

Two RAF Hercules transport planes  airlifted 148 foreign evacuees, most of them British, to Cyprus Thursday from  Sanaa as they fled the fighting in war-torn Yemen.
The evacuees who arrived at Lanarca airport later boarded a British  Airways airliner bound for Gatwick airport, in southern Britain.
The BA plane was due to touch down at 1:20 a.m. (0020 GMT) Friday. The  planes had flown in from Dijoubti to Sanaa earlier Thursday to pick up the  evacuees.
British construction worker Michael Wild said he had heard the blast from  a Scud missile fired by southern forces into the centre of Sanaa on Wednesday  from his hotel 1,000 metres away. It had shattered his hotel room windows.
He quoted local Yemenis as saying that 43 people had been killed and 10  injured in the attack.
The official agency SABA said Wednesday 25 civilians had been killed in  the attack on the Yemeni capital.
A Hungarian neuro surgeon, who asked to be not identified, said "medical  supplies are extremely low" at the main Al-Thawra hospital in Sanaa where he  had been working.
He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were barely  functioning and virtually all the hospital foreign staff mostly Bulgarians and  Indians had left.
About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few days ago, he said
He added about 15 Somali refugees caught in the fighting between rival  north and south forces were admitted with serious bullet wounds. "At least two  of them died later," he said.
Pilot Flight Lieutenant Nick Young said communications at Sanaa airport  were "excellent" and praised the help offered by the Yemeni authorities.
He said he saw no damage to the airport, despite reported bombing raids by  southern jets when the conflict erupted last week.
There were 75 evacuees on one plane and 73 on the other. About 20 were  Americans, but there were also Dutch, New Zealanders, Swiss and Hungarians on  board.
The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20 kilos of  luggage per person.
Oil workers who were working with Yemen-Hunt Oil in the Marib field in  northern Yemen said about 200 oil workers had stayed behind to keep operations  running.
Some said Sanaa appeared to be a "ghost town" with many shops closed, and  long queues at petrol stations.
Wild also added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party building in the  capital had been devastated in an attack and the Italian embassy had been hit.
More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since fighting  erupted between northern troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh and  southern forces backing his rival Ali Salem al-Baid.

Ernie Els was back to his best when the Spanish  Open began at windy Club de Camp here Thursday.
The South African, who makes a habit of false starts, had seven birdies in  his five-under-par 67 to take the lead from Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty and  England's Steven Richardson and Peter Mitchell.
Els rocketed to his first European Tour victory back in January when he  beat world number one Greg Norman by six strokes in the Desert Classic in  Dubai.
But he missed the halfway cut at St Mellion in England last week when he  returned following a two-week break.
"I was a bit rusty but I didn't want to miss the elections back home,"  said the 24-year-old from Johannesburg.
McNulty had five birdies on greens that became very fast in the wind and  sun. "They were just my pace. I liked them very much," he said.
He was playing only his third event on the European Tour this season after  injuring his shoulder playing beach cricket with his children.
Seve Ballesteros was well satisfied with his first round 72 despite being  five shots behind Els.
Last week Ballesteros had 16 pars and two birdies in his final round at  the Benson and Hedges Open at St Mellion for his first tournament success for  more than two years.
Today he parred the first 11 holes and his only two bogeys came when he  missed a three-foot putt at the 13th and a six-footer at the 14th.
"I have been very steady and I should have had a much better score because  I missed five birdie chances in the first nine holes," he said.
Richardson, who has missed the cut in six of his last seven tournaments,  hit his best form of the year when he covered his first nine holes in a  six-under-par 30. But he couldn't keep it up, coming home in 38.

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said  Thursday that a US Senate vote calling for a unilateral lifting of the arms  embargo on Bosnia was a matter of internal politics in the United States.
"I got the impression that this is a message for internal use because the  two amendments adopted are contradictory," Juppe said after senators approved  two separate measures calling for a multilateral lifting of the embargo and  unilateral action by Washington.
"I was able to pick up from my discussions that the House of  Representatives had no intention of approving a compulsory measure," he added.
Juppe said that his discussions with President Bill Clinton and Secretary  of State Warren Christopher reinforced the idea that Washington was not moving  toward a unilateral lifting of the embargo to help the Moslem-led Bosnian  government defend itself.

The evacuees who arrived at Larnaca airport later boarded a British  Airways airliner bound for Gatwick airport, in southern Britain.

Fresh advice from American tennis guru Nick Bolletieri propelled Boris  Becker into his best clay court showing for two years.
The German slowed down enough to beat Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-3, 6-4.  Becker last got this far on clay in Hamburg two years ago when he was beaten  by compatriot Michael Stich in the semi-finals.
Bolletieri, who nurtured Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Monica Seles in  their formative years, has been with the German for three months.
"Nick makes work fun," Becker said. "We have been working on clay for  four weeks and every day I feel that I am playing a little bit better."

Forty young far-rightwingers armed with  knives and sticks chased a group of Turks through the eastern German town of  Magdeburg Thursday, injuring five of them, police said.
The group came across the Turkish people at the end of the afternoon and  chased them through the centre of the town.
Police, who said they made 15 arrests, did not detail the condition of any  of the five injured.

Tottenham Hotspur, the London giants who narrowly  escaped relegation from the English Premiership, could yet go down after being  accused of making "irregular" loans to players.
England star Paul Gascoigne, now with Italian club Lazio, was alleged to  be one of the recipients of the loans, said to have ranged from 25,000 pounds  to 70,000 pounds.
In 1990 Swindon Town, newly promoted to the old-style Division One, were  relegated to Division Three after being found guilty of similar charges. On  appeal they were finally placed in Division Two.
Although the Football Association could relegate Spurs, a heavy fine is  more likely as the alleged offences occurred when Tottenham were under the  jurisdiction of the Football League.
A three-man Premier League inquiry team spent more than six months  investigating the allegations and the inquiry is continuing.
The loans were allegedly made to players between 1985 and 1989. They were  said to be worth more than 400,000 pounds but were never repaid.
The alleged offences occurred before Alan Sugar took control with the now  England manager Terry Venables in 1991.
Further investigations could relate to money allegedly offered by  Tottenham to entice schoolboys to sign for the club.
North London rivals Arsenal were among several clubs who recently  complained of an 87,000 pounds offer by Spurs to 13-year-old schoolboy Scott  Parker.
FA chief executive Graham Kelly said Tottenham had 14 days in which to  answer the charges.
Sugar claimed he had played a major role in bringing the business of the  possible irregular payments to the attention of the game's authorities.
"As soon as I gained full executive control of Tottenham, following the  dismissal of Mr Venables in the summer of 1993, I called a meeting with the FA  and the Premier League for the purpose of alerting them to possible past  irregularities."
Venables had his private business, Edennote, wound up in the London High  Court on Thursday after it ran up a debt of 183,750 pounds to his former club.
The move was a further twist in the long-running dispute between Venables  and Sugar.
Venables has a one million pound legal action pending against the club for  wrongful dismissal, as well as a claim for 100,000 pounds back tax against the  Inland Revenue.

A capsule containing highly radioactive cesium 137  was stolen from a factory in Ukraine, Interfax quoted security officials as  saying Thursday.
Police had no indication as to who stole the capsule in what they  described as a serious incident. A spokesman said the capsule may have been  opened.
Three employees at the factory in Nikolayev were taken to Kiev and Kharkov  for check-ups after displaying symptoms of radiation contamination, while ten  others were undergoing on-the-spot tests.

The US communications giant ITT  announced plans Thursday for a 750 million dollar hotel and casino in Las  Vegas.
"Desert Kingdom," which is to be completed by early 1997, will cover more  than 13 hectares (32 acres) with its huge casino and 2,500-room hotel.
Construction on the complex will begin this year using the latest  water-conservation technology and labor costs alone are estimated to reach  some 500,000 dollars a day. Once completed, the casino will employ about 5,000  workers.
The project, which will be financed through bond issues, follows the  massive 2,500 room "Luxor" hotel-casino which opened last year in Las Vegas to  the tune of 300 million dollars.
ITT owns the Sheraton hotel chain, which company president Kapioltas said  received 140,000 requests for lodging in Las Vegas this year that it could not  meet.
ITT Sheraton has 400 hotels in 61 countries. Its revenues last year  reached 3.2 billion dollars. ITT posted 23 billion dollars in revenues for  1993 and profits were up 28 percent to 219 million dollars for the first  quarter of this year.

Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said  Thursday he had approached Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin with a view to  his party being given places in the government, Interfax said.
The meeting came days after the entry into Chernomyrdin's team of  Democratic Party president Nikolai Travkin, a centrist generally opposed to  President Boris Yeltsin. Travkin did not receive a specific portfolio.
Zhirinovsky said he had spelled out three ways his party could receive  governmental positions, preferably those of defence and interior, along with  the counter-espionage portfolio. His Liberal Democratic Party also has its  sights on the posts of justice minister, as well as the treasury and the  ministry for privatisation.
"The head of the government now has to reflect," Zhirinovsky said. "And we  too are going to reflect on the position we are going to adopt in future  vis-a-vis the government."
Chernomyrdin's office did not comment on the nationalist leader's  statements.
Zhirinovsky has had the foreign ministry, the defence ministry and the  interior porfolio in his sights for the LDP since December's parliamentary  elections gave the party nearly 70 seats in the lower house of parliament.
He recently also demanded the resignation of six ministers.

World Cup fans at Stanford Stadium in California  and in Washington are almost certain to be fenced in, against the wishes of  FIFA and tournament organizers, World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg confirmed  Thursday.
"The position of the organizing committee and FIFA is clear and consistent  -- we are against fencing," Rothenberg said. "Ultimately it's the local law  enforcement that has responsibility for the safety and security of the public.  We don't have any ability to veto their decisions."
He said police in Dallas were also in favor of fences, but were still  discussing the issue.
"We only have the power of persuasion," Rothenberg said. "There is still a  chance there might be modification in Dallas. We're not aware of any possible  changes at Stanford Stadium (in Palo Alto, California) or at RFK Stadium in  Washington."
Though many European clubs have fences, Rothenberg said the trend in  Europe was away from fencing.
Fences were banned in England in 1989 after 95 Liverpool fans were crushed  to death at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield during an FA Cup semi-final.
He also said organizers believed the bulk of fans at World Cup matches did  not pose a threat to the safety of playes and officials on the pitches.
"Two-thirds of our tickets have been sold in the United States," he said.  "All our demographics indicate that is a family audience, a mother and father  and two kids. That's a group as unlikely to anything damaging as any group you  can think of."
Rothenberg said the football associations in countries where hooliganism  is rife had efficient methods of preventing known troublemakers from buying  Cup tickets.
"It is very unlikely that patrons of tour operators are troublemakers," he  said. "And the tickets distributed through the national associations, they  have a pretty good distribution mechanism where they screen who buys. They  tend to know who hooligans are and don't sell to them."

India Thursday offered rewards for information  leading to the arrest of an alleged underworld leader and 43 other suspects in  Bombay bomb blasts last year.
The Central Bureau of Investigation put a prize of 50,000 dollars on  Dawood Ibrahim, who allegedly controls a criminal empire in the western Indian  city from an unknown safe haven abroad.
The same prize was offered for the arrest of Abdul Razak "Tiger" Memon,  his suspected associate in the chain of bomb blasts which killed more than 300  people in Bombay in March last year.
Rewards declared for the arrest of the other suspects range between 25,000  rupees (833 dollars) and one million rupees (33,333 dollars).
Ibrahim and the 43 others, mainly Moslem members of the Bombay underworld,  have been declared fugitives, the bureau said.
According to the agency, Ibrahim sent arms and explosives by sea to the  Indian west coast where one of his accomplices secured a safe landing with the  help of unnamed custom officials.
The transportation of the arms and explosives, their storage in safe  houses in and around Bombay and the blasts were handled by Memon and his  brothers, it said.
The blasts rocked prominent commercial landmarks including the Bombay  Stock Exchange and Air India headquarters, killing 317 people and injuring  nearly 1,000, in the world's worst urban terrorist attack.
Investigators allege the March 1993 explosions were masterminded by  Ibrahim in vengeance for attacks on Moslems by Hindu militants during communal  riots that raged in Bombay in the preceding December and January.
The riots erupted following the destruction of the Babri mosque in the  northern town of Ayodhya by Hindu zealots on December 6, 1992.

A 1947 massacre of native Taiwanese people is to be  mentioned for the first time in history textbooks, officials said Thursday.
A compilation board, made up of scholars and experts, has completed a  draft of the new school textbook including details of the massacre by  Nationalist troops which used to be a taboo subject here, education officials  said.
The massacre, known as the February 28 Incident, which saw thousands of  native Taiwanese people killed, has harmed relations between Taiwan natives  and immigrants from China for many years.
The Nationalist government still ruled mainland China at the time it sent  troops to suppress riots in Taiwan, which had reverted to Chinese rule after  Japan was defeated at the end of World War II in 1945.
The riots were started by native Taiwanese who claimed they were being  ruled high-handedly by the Nationalist-controlled local government in Taiwan.
Now first year junior high school students here will be able to learn of  the massacre in the book, tentatively entitled "Knowing Taiwan," from the  start of the 1995 academic year, the officials said.
The book will also present details of the economic, social and political  conditions during the martial law period from 1949 to 1987.
The Nationalists fled to Taiwan from the mainland after being defeated by  the communists in the 1949 civil war.

China replaced three ministers on Thursday, the  official Xinhua press agency reported.
The ministries of Radio, Film and Television, Geology and Mineral  Resources and the Auditing Administration all got new chiefs, the report  monitored in Hong Kong said.
Sun Jiazheng, 50, takes over as radio, film and television minister, from  Ai Zhisheng; Song Ruixiang, 54, is new head of the geology and mineral  resources ministry, succeeding Zhu Xun, and Guo Zhenqian, 61, becomes  Auditor-general, replacing Lu Peijan.
The new radio minister was head of the propaganda department of the  Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and is a communist party cadre.
Song was vice minister of the geology and mineral resources minister. His  predecessor Zhu becomes secretary-general of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference.
Guo, a former vice-governor of the Peoples' Bank of China, is decibed by  Xinhua as being "familiar with the macro-economy and a capable leader."
The appointments were confirmed by China's parliament at the seventh  session of the standing committe of the National People's Congress, which  ended Thursday, the report said.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin Thursday defended  the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square,  saying China's stability and prosperity had depended on it, Xinhua reported.
Jiang made the comments in a meeting with visiting Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the official news agency said in a report monitored  here.
"A bad thing has been turned into a good thing and as a result our reform  and opening program has forged ahead with steadier, better and even quicker  steps and our advantages have been brought into fuller play," Xinhua quoted  him as saying.
"History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good,"  Jiang said.
"The stability of China is not only needed for China's own development,  but will also benefit the stability of Asia and the world in general," he  added.
Mahathir said he had been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in  China and that his government was satisfied with the steady growth of economic  and trade ties with China, the report said.
Referring to his meeting in Washington with US President Bill Clinton  shortly before his arrival in China, Mahathir said he had stressed that one  country should not try to impose its views on another, Xinhua said.
He added that he had expressed his opposition to Washington's using  renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status as a way to pressure  Beijing.
Clinton is due to make a decision by June 3 on renewing MFN status for  China.
Earlier Mahathir met Chinese Premier Li Peng, with both sides approving of  developing bilateral ties.
They also agreed on using dialogue to settle the Spratly islands issue.
The tiny islands in the South China Sea are believed to have important oil  deposits under them and are also claimed in whole or in part Vietnam, Brunei,  the Philippines and Taiwan.
Mahathir is in Beijing to attend a high-profile international seminar on  China's economic future, which ended Friday.

Argentina have called off their two football  internationals in Japan after Japanese authorities refused team captain Diego  Maradona entry because of his drugs record.
Osamo Ighami, first counsel at the Japanese embassy, said Argentine  Football Association president Julio Grondona had told him of the decision.
Ighami said the justice ministry ruling which barred Maradona was  irreversible.
The Japanese justice ministry refused Maradona a visa because it said he  had been implicated in drug cases more than once.
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for cocaine possession, and  five months later was given a 14-month suspended sentence by an Italian court  for using cocaine.
He was also suspended from international competition for 15 months in 1991  and 1992 after testing postive for cocaine use.
The justice ministry's immigration bureau, however, granted a visa to  Claudio Caniggia, who recently ended a 13-month soccer ban for his alleged use  of cocaine. Caniggia would have been allowed to go to Japan because he had not  faced criminal charges.
Argentine had planned to play Japan and France in Japan as part of their  World Cup buildup.

A 26-year-old anorexic's fight for  survival hung in the balance Thursday as the British woman awaited the outcome  of a media bidding battle for her exclusive story.
The woman, whose twin sister has already dieted herself to death, was  relying on the outcome of a battle between such British media giants as  Granada Television and the Daily Mirror newspaper to pay her medical bills at  an exclusive clinic which specializes in bringing victims of anorexia and  bulimia back to the world of the living.
Samantha Kendall, 26, is due to check in some time next week at the  Montreux Society for Eating Disorders clinic, in a converted mansion in this  posh Pacific coast city.
But first she is scheduled to appear in New York on the Maury Povitch  Show, a television chat show on the Fox Television Network which has agreed to  pay some of Kendall's expenses.
Then, if everything goes well, Kendall will be flown to British Columbia  to check in for between six months and a year, said the clinic's spokeswoman  Laurie Winn Stanley.
Winn Stanley said the cost of the treatment could run anywhere from 75,000  Canadian dollars (54,000 US) to 200,000 dollars (144,000 US), depending on the  patient's length of stay.
"In our experience," Winn Stanley told AFP, "she will need to be here for  at least six months and, depending on her progress, she might have to stay for  a year.
"So we have to be fairly sure that our costs will be covered. We are a  non-profit organisation and we are not able to carry the costs ourselves."
Hence the importannce of the media bidding battle in Britain.
"We've advised the family how to go about it. But the mother (Susie, 47)  hasn't listened to us. I believe she gave a television interview in Britain  for just 2,000 pounds (less than 3,000 USD).
"They really must get the money together."
Winn Stanley said she was waiting for news from Britain about the bidding  battle. She said she understood the bidders included Granada Television,  Central Tevision and the Daily Mirror -- "it seems Granada and the Daily  Mirror are the front-runners, but there's no shortage of bidders."
---
If Samantha's bid for the money is successful, her bid for life will start  next week in what Winn Stanley described as "a large mansion with three suites  with up to two patients in each suite."
Winn Stanley said that, initially, Samantha would need around-the-clock  care during which she would be hand-fed by two professional carers.
"There is no force-feeding, there are no tubes," insisted Winn Stanley.
Stage two, once the patient has returned to a pattern of fairly normal  eating, is therapy, said Winn Stanley.
"It's intensive," she said. "It's a very supporting environment."
Samantha's problems began 13 years ago when she and her twin sister,  Michaela, made a "slimming pact" when they were sick of being teased at school  for being overweight.
But nearly four weeks ago, Michaela died -- suffering from anorexia  nervosa, the so-called dieter's disease. Michaela weighed just 25 kilos (56  pounds) when she died.
A shocked Samantha appeared on British television this week admitting: "I  don't know how much time I have left because the dieting has done so much to  my body."
Appearing emaciated and cadaver-like, Samantha told another reporter in a  separate interview: "My bones are sticking out so much now that it's too  painful to even lie in the bath."
The girls' mother said the twins each weighed 82 kilos (182 pounds) when  as 14-year-olds they made their pact which would prove so deadly.
Despite massive drops in weight, psychiatric counselling and hospital  treatment, the girls continued their death diet into adulthood.

UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  recommended Thursday that the United Nations clearly define the boundaries  around the six designated safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In a report to the Security Council released Thursday, the secretary  general also said that UN Protection Forces have been stretched to the limit  and should not be asked to establish more safe havens in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The United Nations should define precise boundaries for the six existing  safe areas of Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac,  Boutros-Ghali said.
Brcko had been proposed as another site for a safe area.
The United Nations established the six safe zones about 18 months ago to  protect Bosnian Moslem populations concentrated in those areas from relentless  Bosnian Serbian attack.
The difficulty in using already overburdened peacekeeping forces to  establish the zones and protect the population makes safe havens a temporary  solution and precludes the United Nations from creating more of them, he said.
"UNPROFOR, overstretched and underresourced as it is in relation to its  current mandates, does not have the capacity to rush from crisis to crisis in  different areas.
"It is neither configured nor equipped for mandates to fight or to hold  ground," he said, adding that it is designed for quick deployment rather than  fixed position.
"These factors dictate clear limits to the concept of safe areas," he  stressed.
He also pointed to a recent council resolution demanding a halt to all  provocative action in security zones, a demand apparently aimed at Bosnian  Moslems who have recently been accused of violating rules governing the safe  areas.
"It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a  long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina,  which requires a political and territorial solution," he said.

Once dubbed India-No-Place because  nothing exciting ever happened here, this central US city is preparing for its  greatest weekend ever.
Along with the traditional excitement of pole qualifying for the  Indianapolis 500, the city plays host to a visit by US president Bill Clinton  and two sold-out National Basketball Association playoff games.
Add a Star Trek convention and sports memorabilia show to the mix and you  have the busiest event schedule here since the 1987 Pan American Games.
"It's quite a weekend," Indiana Pacers vice president Dale Raterman said.  "Sports fans here are excited. They've really caught the fever."
Indy 500 time trials begin Saturday, with more than 250,000 people  expected at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Qualifying continues Sunday as racers  attempt to fill the 33-car field for the May 29 race.
But adding to the excitement are the Indiana Pacers, who have advanced to  the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time ever. They play  Atlanta here Saturday and Sunday afternoons in downtown Market Square Arena,  while the qualifying continues on the west side of town.
---
"We want a little May madness of our own," Indiana guard Reggie Miller  said. "We know this is a big time at the speedway, but I would like to see  some of the drivers at our game."
Miller might have to wait until Sunday, after most of the top racers have  made the field. But he vows to support any drivers who support the Pacers.
"I want to see Emmo Fittipaldi, Raul Boesel, Mario and Michael Andretti  and the rest cheering for us," Miller said. "I've never been to the speedway,  but if they come, I will go there. That's a fair trade off."
The NBA-Indy 500 conflict has caused the greatest problem for Indianapolis  media sports coordinator Bill York, who handles press duties for the speedway  as well as the city's NBA and National Football League clubs. He cannot be in  two places at once, so the 60-year-old manager will handle first-day speedway  duties and rejoin the Pacers on Sunday.
"It's too involved out here on Saturday with everybody qualifying," York  said. "It's a shame to have to miss one or the other."
Reports said Clinton feels the same way. Rumors have him scheduled to  attend at least part of the Pacers' game and 500 time trials. He is here for a  political meeting and to dedicate a memorial to Bobby Kennedy.
Clinton attended the US college basketball finals because his home-state  Arkansas Razorbacks were involved.

The Senate defied President Bill Clinton on  Thursday by approving a measure that would require the United States to lift  the arms embargo against Bosnia unilaterally.
Although the amendment, approved 50 to 49, has little chance of becoming  law, it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on  resolving the conflict.
The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US  administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms  shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war.
Although Clinton has pressed for a multilateral lifting of the embargo, he  has maintained that a unilateral effort by Washington could undermine other UN  actions around the world.
The measure goes to the House of Representatives, where it was expected to  have little chance of passage. But even if it were approved, Clinton could  veto the measure, and a two-thirds majority of both houses would be needed to  override the veto.
Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell said the measure had no chance of  becoming law.
Earlier, senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment  sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies  to lift the embargo. By placing the two amendments in the same bill, senators  appeared to give contradictory directives to the president.
---
"Lifting the arms embargo is the only feasible option that will permit the  Bosnian government to defend itself," said Senator Joseph Biden following the  vote on the bill.
The administration had no immediate comment on the vote but State  Department spokesman Michael McCurry said earlier that passing the measure  would be "problematic."
He also suggested it would send a conflicting message to Geneva, when the  foreign ministers from Europe, Russia and the United States will be meeting to  discuss the Balkan conflict Friday.
Europe and Russia have argued that an end to the arms embargo would  escalate the fighting and quash any chance to resolve the conflict  diplomatically.
In New York, a diplomat said that the Security Council was unlikely to  approve a resolution lifting the embargo, noting that even if it had a  majority among the 15 members Russia would be sure to veto it.
Last year, a resolution introduced by Moslem and non-aligned countries to  exempt Bosnian Moslems from the sanctions won only six of the nine votes  necessary to pass. Five non-aligned members and the United States supported  the resolution.
Earlier Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,  said that lifting the arms embargo would not help efforts to bring peace to  Bosnia-Hercegovina after more than two years of brutal war.
"From a humanitarian point of view ... the number one objective I would  like to see achieved is a ceasefire. Number two is a political settlement,"  she said. "I hope all the meetings and decisions would lead to these two  objectives."
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic had appealed to members to pass the  bill, and thanked Dole and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman for introducing  it.
"The hopes of the Bosnian people are turned to the United States Senate,"  he said recently.

The US government plans to help send 2,000  buses from around the nation to Atlanta for use at the 1996 Olympics.
The Federal Transit Administration plans to use 16 million dollars in  discretionary funds to help pay to deliver and prepare the buses, which will  be fitted with communications equipment to promote scheduling flexibility.
The buses will be identified by their cities of origin. Transit  authorities in New York, Houston, Birmingham, New Orleans, St. Louis, Orlando,  Philadelphia and the state of New Jersey have pleged buses so far.
Games organizers predict 1.5 million visitors will flood Atlanta each day  of the Olympics. Parts of the city will be closed to private cars and  spectators will use Atlanta city buses and trains and the borrowed buses to  reach events.

A former Italian health minister nicknamed  Torquemada for his inquisitorial raids on hospitals to unmask fraud was  arrested on corruption charges Thursday, judicial sources said in Naples.
The arrest of Francesco De Lorenzo of the Liberal Party comes after an  investigation into bribes paid by pharmaceutical laboratories to a ministry  official, to win government backing for higher prices.
The former minister, charged on 67 counts, is accused of receiving seven  billion lira (4.5 million dollars) in bribes between 1990 and 1992.
The charges also cover his relations with advertising companies which  carried out AIDS public awareness campaigns.
De Lorenzo, 56, is an eminent doctor and popular television personality  whose family is descended from the Neopolitan aristocracy.
He made his mark by campaigning against hospital fraud, earning the  nickname Torquemada after descending on wards to unmask corruption.
But he was forced to resign in February 1993 after his 89-year-old father  was arrested for receiving commission on the sale of a building.

Gunmen burst into a house in north Belfast  Thursday and killed a man at close range, police said.
The outlawed loyalist organisation the Ulster Freedom Fighters said they  carried out the attack in a call to a local radio station.
According to a spokesman for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed  Irish Republican Army fighting British rule in Northern Ireland, the victim  was a Catholic aged around 20 but not a Sinn Fein member.
The killing brought to 24 the number of people killed in sectarian  violence in Northern Ireland since the start of the year.

Blue-chip stocks rallied Thursday amid easing  long-term interest rates after the government released figures showing  inflation under control.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.80 points to close at 3,652.84.
On the broader market, advancers outpaced decliners 1,184 to 977 with 659  shares unchanged. Some 274 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock  Exchange.
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond fell  to 7.57 percent from 7.59 percent Wednesday, a sign of easing investor fears  of inflation and higher rates.
The rates declined further earlier in the day but rebounded after San  Francisco Federal Reserve president Robert Parry suggested he might favor  boosting short-term rates again.
The decline in interest rates came after the release of a government  report showing wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in April, surprising analysts.
The reports "relieve some of the fear that the economy was going to  explode on the upside," said Alfred Goldman of A.G. Edwards and Sons.
But he added that investors still have not ruled out another interest rate  hike by the Federal Reserve, which has already raised rates three times this  year.
Allied-Signal rose 1-1/2 to 35-3/4, Sears 1-1/4 to 48-3/4 and Philip  Morris 3 to 50-1/2.
ITT fell 1-1/4 to 82-3/4 after announcing plans for a new Las Vegas  casino,  Texas Instruments was off 1-1/4 to 71-1/2 and J.P Morgan 3/4 to  61-5/8.

The PLO on Thursday gave Israel a partial list of  members of the Palestinian authority due to take power next week in Gaza and  Jericho, the chief Palestinian negotiator said.
Nabil Shaath told a press conference "the (Palestinian) cabinet has been  formed, I just transmitted it to Yitzhak Rabin," the Israeli prime minister.
He said the PLO had agreed with Rabin that the new authority "will be  functional from Wednesday."
But he added the list given was still incomplete as it had only 15 of the  24 (eds: correct) members. The other nine would be appointed in three of four  days at the latest.
He said the members included PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Faisal Husseini,  the leading PLO official in the occupied territories, Hanan Ashrawi, former  spokeswoman of the negotiating team, Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian team  to the bilateral talks and Shaath himself.
He said Arafat was due to enter the autonomous territories in June but  "Arafat may have some surprises for us, and it could happen before that date."
Shaath justified sending the partial list to Rabin saying "the Israelis  want to be sure that we are serious."
But Samir Goshe, leader of the Popular Struggle Front, denied in Tunis  that he had officially agreed to take part in the authority, saying he had  made his involvement conditional on a "democratisation" of the PLO's working  methods.
He said he had been surprised to see his name on the list announced by  Shaath.
A Palestinian official at the PLO headquarters in Tunis said Arafat will  continue his consultations over the remaining positions.
According to Shaath, the PLO's offices for foreign affairs, refugees and  its relations with Israel and Jewish organisations would stay in its Tunis  headquarters.

Under last week's PLO-Israel accord on implementing limited Palestinian  self-rule in the Gaza strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, the authority  is due to take over on May 25.
Meanwhile in Jerusalem a police spokesman said Rabin had agreed to a draft  plan to set up a special police section to deal specifically with issues  relating to Palestinian autonomy.
Under the project devised by Police Minister Moshe Shahal 2,000 men will  be temporarily based in the Maalei Adumin settlement in the occupied West Bank.
The spokesman said its role would be to supervise the organisation of  Israeli-Palestinian patrols in Gaza and Jericho.
The partial list announcement came as 20 Palestinian policemen arrived in  the Jericho region, and another group of 300 policemen was due to be deployed  in Gaza later on Thursday following the initial 300.
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza  and Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday.
In all, 9,000 Palestinian policemen are due to be deployed in Gaza and  Jericho.

Easy Goer, whose rivalry with Sunday  Silence defined the 1989 US racing season, died of natural causes Thursday at  Claiborne Farm.
The eight-year-old stallian was a son of Alydar. He won 14 of 20 starts,  with five seconds and one third, and was retired in 1990 after earning more  than 4,873,770 dollars.
Easy Goer was the champion 2-year-old of 1998. He won his first three  starts in 1989 and started as favorite at the Kentucky Derby, which he lost to  Sunday Silence.
He finished runner-up to Sunday Silence in the Preakness, but ruined  Sunday Silence's bid for the Triple Crown with an eight-length victory in the  Belmont.

Eleven French aid workers held hostage by Bosnian  Serbs forces for the last month will probably be freed next week, the Bosnian  Serb news agency SRNA said Thursday.
Charges against the 11, accused of smuggling weapons to the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army, "will be revised in their favour" and handed to the civil  courts, said the agency, quoting sources close to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic.
"It is expected that (their) preventive detention will be lifted from next  week and they will be returned to freedom," the agency said.
Earlier on Thursday, France's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news  conference in Washington that the group might be freed in the next day or two.
Juppe said France had let it be known it would not accept this "parody of  justice" and would not bargain for their freedom.
"If the news is confirmed, it would be the culmination of a daily effort  by French diplomacy," Juppe said.
The relief workers, members of a group called Premiere Urgence (First  Aid), have been held in a Serb prison since April 8 in the Sarajevo suburb of  Lukavica.

The 47th Cannes International Film Festival  opened Thursday with jury president Clint Eastwood stealing the show even  before the world's biggest filmfest got under way.
As the the world's cinema industry settled into its seats for the 12-day   cinematic banquet, Eastwood dominated proceedings with his humour and  incidentally with his love of music.
At the official inauguration ceremony at the Grand Theatre Lumiere in the  Festival Palace here, French actress Juliette Binoche declared the festival  open in a multi-lingual address reflecting the festival's global stature.
Starting in Chinese and finishing in French, Binoche welcomed the movie  industry to the French riviera. "I declare the 47th International Film  Festival open," she said, to loud applause.
But even before the ceremony Eastwood made Cannes' day by pledging that  the next 12 days should be for the average film-goer rather than art  specialists or critics.
"I haven't really done any studying for it because ... we're going to be  viewing strictly from an amateur point of view," said the actor-turned  director, presenting his jury to the press.
"Some of us may have have acted as critics at one point or another, but  for the most part its just as film-goers," he said.
And, breaking the ice at a press conference, he praised his  vice-president, French actress Catherine Deneuve.
"She's much prettier than Al Gore," he said.
Then at the inaugural ceremony, hosted by Binoche's compatriot, French  actress Jeanne Moreau, Eastwood again stole the show when a "surprise"  saxophone fanfare, including a serenade by saxophonist Archie Shepp, greeted  his arrival on stage.
Eastwood, director of the 1988 hommage to Charlie Parker "Bird" and known  for his love of jazz, looked suitably grateful, before helping Moreau welcome  his eight jury members onto the stage.
The inaugural ceremony, broadcast live on French television, was followed  by the premiere of the festival's opening film, "The Hudsucker Proxy" by US  filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.
The brothers scored a hit in 1991 by taking the Palme d'Or in their first  appearance here with "Barton Fink."
But they played down the prospect of a repeat performance, saying they were  simply happy to have been invited back, with their latest offering, a romantic  comedy set on Wall Street starring Tim Robbins and Paul Newman.
In all 23 films in the festival's main competition are hoping to succeed  Jane Campion's "The Piano" and Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine" as winners  of the Palme d'Or on May 23.
As well as the main competition, films are also being shown out of  competition in categories called Un Certain Regard (A Certain Regard), the  Director's Fortnight and the Camera D'Or, for first-time filmmakers.
A retrospective of French film icon Jean Renoir has also been organized to  mark the 100th anniversary of his birth, and a selection of the films of  Federico Fellini is also on offer.
On Friday the competition proper gets under way with the French favourite  "La Reine Margot" (Queen Margot) by Patrice Chereau, starring Isabelle Adjani,  and "Du Li Sha Dai" (Confuscius' Confusion) by Taiwan's Edward Yang.

Northern forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah  Saleh said late Thursday they had shot down a southern warplane over the road  to the stronghold of Aden.
A northern military spokesman told the official news agency SABA that  northern troops had also launched a series of air raids against the airport in  Ataq, in Shabwa province about 300 kilometres (180 miles) east of Aden.
As the battle raged around the strategic town of Al Daleh, he said that  northern forces had seized Soviet-built T-62 tanks in Abyan, southeast of  Aden, as well as arms and ammunition from Al Daleh.
Earlier Information Minister Hassan Ahmed al-Lozi said: "The town of Al  Daleh has fallen" to northern troops.
Aid officials in Aden said 60 families, numbering around 300 people, had  arrived there after fleeing Al Daleh 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of Aden,  and were being housed in two schools.
As the two sides traded claim and counter-claim, Lozi said northern forces  had captured a southern mechanised brigade based at Kharaz, about 130  kilometres (80 miles) west of Aden.
But both reports were denied by the southern leadership in Aden, which  said an offensive had been repelled and northern troops had been pushed back  to Kataba, 10 kilometres (six miles) further to the north.
Southern spokesmen in Aden said they launched a counter attack and retook  positions they had lost to their northern rivals.
Earlier Thursday southern forces said they had shot down three northern  warplanes and sunk a warship in the Kharaz region near the strategic Bab  el-Mandab Straits on the Red Sea.
Saleh's General People's Congress called on Yemenis to rally to "the side  of legitimacy to scupper and condemn the crimes committed by the bloodied  Baid" referring to ousted Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid.
In a communique published in Sanaa the GPC called on the Yemenis to  "openly condemn the terrorist band and the traitors in the heart of the  (southern) Yemen Socialist Party."
The armies of the former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since last Thursday, shattering the uneasy four year union between the  conservative north and Marxist south.
Meanwhile, the Arab League held a meeting with Yemeni leaders in Sanaa to  try to broker a ceasefire between Saleh and Baid.
Their feud erupted into all-out war last Thursday, with southern air raids  and Scud missile attacks on Sanaa and a northern offensive targeted on Aden.

A death row inmate wants the world  to see his execution as he fights a warden's order banning his death being   broadcast on national television.
The televising of his death will bring meaning to his life, said convicted  killer David Lawson.
It will also draw attention to the chronic depression he claims led hi8m  to kill.
State officials said televising the death will make a spectacle of what  should be regarded a somber event. A state supreme court judge is expected to  rule on the issue shortly.
Lawson is slated for death on June 15. He was convicted of murder when he  shot a man during 1980 home break-in.
Execution in North Carolina is by gas or lethal injection. North Carolina  has executed five people since resuming the death penalty in 1984, all by  injection. Lawson has until five days before his execution to decide which  method he wants.
North Carolina bars cameras at executions, but allows five reporters,  including one from television, to witness the deaths.
The event reopens debate on the issue. National talk show host Phil  Donohue has joined Lawson in his request to the North Carolina Supreme Court  to overturn the ban.
Attempts in 1991 by a California television station to show the  gas-chamber death of an inmate failed when a judge ruled against the broadcast  and ordered tapes of the death destroyed.
"It would only satisfy the thirst for vengeance that is unwarranted," said  George Gerbner, dean emeritus of the Annenberg School of Communications at the  University of Pennsylvania.
"It's a ghoulish spectacle that's bound to have a brutalizing,  desensitizing effect on a public already jaded by images of violence," he  added.
Secretary of Correction Franklin Freeman said the execution "should not be  turned into a circus."
He said the events surrounding the execution of serial killer John Wayne  Gacy on Tuesday in Illinois demonstrate his point. People waited outside  Gacy's prison in a festive atmosphere, with vendors selling T-shirts saying  "No Tears for the Clown."
Gacy, a building contractor who often entertained at parties dressed as a  clown, was executed for murdering 33 young men and boys during the 1970s.
"The conduct certain people exhibited there is an example of the kind of  conduct that would be inspired by public broadcast of executions," said  Freeman.
---
He said televising the events would be the modern-day equivalent of public  hangings which attracted hundreds of vendors and spectators before they were  halted. The last public hanging in North Carolina took place in 1910.
Lawson said the broadcast would highlight the plight of people who suffer  from chronic depression. He said he was not aware he suffered from it until he  was on Death Row.
"I'm a human being and not a monster," said Lawson Tuesday during an  interview with NBC television.
"It's all about making the whole story public in order to help somebody  else who's suffering," said Marshall Dayan, Lawson's attorney.

Killings and threats of increased violence  have overshadowed preparations for a presidential vote next week, even though  the parties signed a civility pact to guarantee peace during the balloting.
Already around 30 people have died in political violence during street  protests and rallies for the May 16 poll that pits President Joaquin Balaguer  against Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a black leader of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party. Most recent surveys put them in a dead heat.
Also running is former president Juan Bosch of the Independent  Revolutionary Party. Bosch was ousted in a 1965 coup.
Balaguer and Pena Gomez urged their supporters Thursday to refrain from  violence during the final campaign events, which conclude Saturday. The two  leading candidates signed a "Civility Pact" on Tuesday.
Despite plenty of election slogans there is in fact few differences  between the candidates.
All praise current economic structural adjustment programs and plans to  sell state enterprises pushed by the International Monetary Fund and World  Bank.
But the opposition has argued that 87-year-old Balaguer, who is nearly  blind, is too old to remain president.
Both leading candidates have promised to create jobs for the estimated 30  percent of the economically active population that is out of work. Both have  also promised higher salaries and improved access to education and health care.
The Dominican Republic's 7.3 million people are about 15 percent white, 10  percent black and 75 percent mixed race. Per capital income is about 790  dollars annually while about 20 percent of the population is illiterate.
Some of the 2.5 million residents of the capital also began hoarding food  in anticipation of demonstrations. "This is normal, they always do this," one  supermarket manager said. "People buy just in case, but that does not mean  that there will be problems."
Nerves were shaken when Jacinto Peinado, the vice president of the ruling  Christian Social Reformist Party, said Wednesday that he had information that  the opposition had plans to hold demonstrations on Monday afternoon to disrupt  voting for president, 30 senators, 120 deputies and 103 mayors.
And the Democratic Revolutionary Party accused the ruling party of  instructing its observers to contest the results of any voting stations where  the opposition prevailed.
---
"The election will be clean and pure," said Balaguer, who is seeking a  third, four-year term. "It (the pact) will calm citizens frightened by  disagreeable events."
But the pact has not entirely calmed the nation's nerves.
In a television appearance early Wednesday, Pena Gomez spokes ominously of  plans by top military officers called Operation Scorpio that he declined to  detail.
"I have information that Operation Scorpio expressed judgements that I do  not want to repeat," said Pena Gomez, who has pledged to improve the lot of  the nation's 23,000 soldiers.
Army spokesman said that soldiers would be in their barracks throughout  the weekend unless needed to restore order.
In a four-paragraph statement released Thursday, the military chiefs of  staff said: "The occasion has arisen to emphasize that public order will be  maintained firmly and energetically, in obedience with democratic norms."
The Organization of American States (OAS) has sent a team of 47 observers  for the election.
Also as part of the pact, mediated by Roman Catholic church officials,  parties promised to withdraw offensive campaign advertisements that have  dominated this Caribbean nation's campaign.
But as of midday Thursday they were still being broadcast on television  and radio.

The dollar lost ground against the major  currencies Thursday in New York exchange as traders awaited more data on  inflation trends in the United States.
Gold fell 1.90 dollars from Wednesday's closing price to 379.90 dollars an  ounce.
Around 5:00 p.m. (2100 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6675 German marks  against 1.6690 marks late Wednesday and 104.22 yen against 104.30.
The greenback also fell to 5.7200 French francs against 5.7250 Wednesday,  0.6669 pounds sterling from 0.6693 and 1.4245 Swiss francs against 1.4255.
Jim Moore of American Security Bank said traders were awaiting a  government report Friday on retail prices to get a better picture of  inflation. A report Thursday showed wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in April.
Trading was light with the markets hesitant ahead of next Tuesday's  meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, which could take action  on short-term interest rates.

Double chasers Manchester United are praying that  small will not beautiful in Saturday's FA Cup Final.
The English giants' march towards their second successive league title was  twice, if ultimately only temporarily, stopped in its tracks by Chelsea's  economy-sized strike force.
On both occasions, United's normally unflappable centre backs, Steve Bruce  and Gary Pallister, reminded one of those cartoon elephants who are scared  stiff of mice, as they were spun one way and then another by the likes of  Dennis Wise, John Spencer, Mark Stein and most notably, Gavin Peacock.
Peacock and Stein, in particular, will have good reason to approach with  confidence an occasion for which many would rely on bravado.
The former, with his penetrating runs from deep positions, scored both  goals in successive 1-0 victories at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford.
The latter, who made an unexpected return from injury to score the two  goals that relegated Sheffield United last week, also hit a brace earlier in  the season to give his former club, Stoke City, a 2-1 first-leg victory over  United in the League Cup.
As a pair, they have that chalk and cheese factor that would do justice to  a couple of buddy movie cops: Peacock, the clean-cut Christian with the  college boy looks; Stein, the callow ragamuffin, who has had to take the slow  route to the top, weighed down, according to his first manager David Pleat, by  the hefty chip on his shoulder.
His angry years at Luton, Queens Park Rangers, Oxford United and Stoke now  apparently behind him, the Cape Town born striker afforded a refreshingly  modest response to last week's triumphant comeback.
"I would not say I have guaranteed my final place but I think I have given  the gaffer a decision to make," he said.
With Chelsea's diminutive quartet having a relatively free role to harass  United's back four, heavy responsibility will fall on the anchor position in  midfield.
Romantic as it may be to visualise the Blues' player-manager Glenn Hoddle  strutting the Cup Final stage for the fourth time, at 36 he would not relish  the prospect of an afternoon chasing the deep shadows of United's orchestrator  Eric Cantona.
Much will be expected then of arguably Hoddle's brightest young protege,  Eddie Newton, who at 22 has the potential to join the England midfield dynasty  of Robson, Platt and Ince.
Provided Cantona's penetrative passing is not hindered by Wembley's  unseasonally long grass (it is significant that the Frenchman has hit peak  form on the worn end-of-season pitches) and Giggs and Kanchelskis find the  freedom to pit their wits against Clarke and Sinclair, it is reasonable to  conclude that United can make it third time lucky.

Alex Ferguson side's defeat at Stamford Bridge could easily have gone the  other way, and the Old Trafford setback was the start of an early spring blip,  now well behind them.
If Fergie fails to become the fourth double-winning manager this century,  he will at least hope his decision to bring back goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel  does not backfire on him.
The Dane's fumbles at Wimbledon, and against Oldham in the FA Cup  semi-final, not to mention his sentry-style reluctance to leave his posts on  crosses, have been put into still more grim perspective by stand-in Gary  Walsh's confident handling in United's last two matches against Southampton  and Coventry.
United fans can only hope that Schmeichel's assurances that he has  recovered from his ankle injury are motivated more by conviction than by his  desperation to make up for missing the League Cup final against Aston Villa  through suspension.
Chelsea supporters will be encouraged by history, which, albeit  marginally,  weighs against United emulating Tottenham in 1961, Arsenal in  1971 and Liverpool in 1986 by pulling off the double.
If United's only uncapped player, Steve Bruce, does lift the Cup, manager  Ferguson says the double will be dedicated to the club's recently deceased  patriarch, Sir Matt Busby, whose legendary "babes" failed in a similar quest  in 1957 at the final hurdle against Aston Villa.
United themselves foiled domestic double chasing bids by Liverpool in 1977  and Everton in 1985, with Cup Final victories. Liverpool failed again in 1988  when they were beaten at Wembley by Wimbledon.
Frank McLintock, Arsenal's 1971 double-winning skipper, believes United  will triumph, but he has warned them against what he calls the "Jack the Lad"  syndrome.
The former Scotland defender said: "The important thing in a situation  like this is to keep your feet on the ground and avoid thinking you are better  than you really are.
"As soon as anyone does that they can get nailed. You can come unstuck.          "Liverpool always had a knack of bringing people down to earth. We tried  to copy it and it worked for us."
McLintock recalled: "We had Charlie George, who in some ways was like  Cantona.
"He could ping the ball 40 yards with the outside of his foot like a table  tennis ball.
"But aspects like closing people down and denying opponents chances are  just as important as the glitter of the game."
Probable teams
Manchester United: Schmeichel; Parker, Bruce, Pallister, Irwin;  Kanchelskis, Keane, Ince, Giggs; Cantona, Hughes. Substitutes; Walsh, two from  McClair, Sharpe, Robson
Chelsea: Kharine; Clarke, Johnsen, Kjeldbjerg, Sinclair; Burley, Newton,  Peacock, Wise; Spencer, Stein. Substitutes; Hitchcock, Hoddle, Cascarino

Hundreds of jubilant residents  finally tracked down a vanguard of 20 Palestinian police officers as they  waited outside Jericho Thursday ready to take over from the Israeli army.
Another 40 officers and 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, are due to  follow Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town to the  Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
Military sources said the officers will be part of the Jericho  coordination office in charge of joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols in the  area.
"If all goes well, all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by  Friday afternoon," said Colonel Herzl, a member of the commmittee whose full  name was withheld for security reasons.
It was only after nightfall that residents finally managed to find the  officers who were spending their first night in the West Bank in the shadow of  the Jewish settlement Vered Jericho.
Many townspeople who had gathered earlier on the main road into Jericho to  welcome the men had spent a frustrating day chasing around as the police were  taken on a tour to inspect the Jericho region.
But despite the late hour more than 200 men, women and youngsters  eventually turned out to give the officers a hero's welcome.
The officers, new rifles hung across their shoulders embraced  well-wishers, as women ululated with joy. The night promised to be long as  more people heard of the officers' arrival and drove up to the farm.
"We would have waited up all night to see them," said Musbah Khalil, 25.
"This is a golden moment. Now I really feel I'm alive, not like before."
General Yom Tov Samia, head of the Israeli delegation to the  Israeli-Palestinian military liaison committee, said earlier there were still  "details about security to sort out" after joint talks about the Israeli  pullout.
But he added they had "studied the problem of joint patrols and we are  ready to leave."
The Palestinian officers, who were each given a Klashnikov or a Carl  Gustav rifle on leaving the border, had lunched with senior Israeli officers,  then inspected the 62 square kilometers (25 square miles) that are to come  under Palestinian autonomy.
The Israeli army is also redeploying in Gaza to protect the 4,000 settlers  who remain there and pulled out of Rafah town earlier Thursday, where the  first 300 police have already arrived.
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza and  Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday.
"Our forces are ready to come immediately. Moreover we have the feeling  that we are finally in our own country," Yussef said.
Earlier a PLO official told AFP that more than 300 members of the new  Palestinian police force bound for the Gaza Strip were stuck at the Rafah  border terminal with Egypt.
He refused to elaborate on the delay, but said the Israelis had not handed  out the application forms for identity cards for the men, ex-soldiers of the  PLO's Palestine Liberation Army.
But about 300 police crossed the Allenby Bridge from Jordan late Thursday  and headed for the Gaza Strip via the West Bank and Israel, a Palestinian  spokesman said in Amman
They will be the first armed Palestinians to cross Israeli territory under  Israeli army escort.
Unlike the overcrowded Gaza Strip with its population of about 800,000,  the Jericho police are taking over a quiet oasis of 15,000 people, which is  known as both the oldest and lowest town in the world.
Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS shot and wounded an  Israeli soldier and a truck driver in the first two attacks on the Gaza Strip  since autonomy was launched a week ago.

A group of Russian deputies led by Ivan Rybkin,  president of the Duma, is to go to China Friday for a five-day official visit,  a parliamentary spokesman said Thursday, quoted by the agency ITAR-TASS.
The delegation is to visit a metal works and the Shenzhen economic zone  bordering Hong Kong, said Dmitri Biriokov, spokesman of the Duma or lower  house.
The trip comes ahead of an official visit to China by Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin later this month.
In Beijing, officials said Thursday that visit would take place on May 26  to 29. In Moscow the premier's office confirmed that Chernomyrdin would visit  at the end of the month but did not give precise dates.

Spanish football reaches boiling point this weekend  as the last day proves decisive for the third year running amid rumours of  corruption.
Deportivo La Coruna, at home to Valencia, are a point ahead of Johan  Cruyff's Barcelona, who entertain UEFA Cup hopefuls Sevilla at the Nou Camp  stadium.
Spanish press is speculating over alleged handouts to Valencia players  from mysterious Catalonian intermediaries. Two years ago press reports claimed  Tenerife players were payed from a Barcelona source for their last-ditch home  victory over Real Madrid which handed Barcelona the title.
History repeated itself last season when Tenerife beat Madrid, again on  the last day, to bring Barcelona their third consecutive championship. And the  press once again claimed Barcelona backers had made illicit payments.
Further controversy has come about over the timing of the matches of both  Deportivo and Barcelona. The Spanish federation has brought forward those  fixtures, and the Athletic Bilbao-Tenerife match to Saturday at 8:30pm (1830  GMT).
La Coruna president Cesar Augusto Lendoiro complained bitterly, saying  Sunday tickets have been on sale for weeks.
Lendoiro agreed Barcelona should be able to alter their schedule because  they play in the European Cup final against AC Milan in Athens next Wednesday.
But, realising Deportivo would have a distinct advantage should the  Catalonians play a day earlier, Lendoiro has appealed to the Spanish  federation, and may even resort to legal action.
Deportivo are understandably wary about any possible outside influences.
Deportivo have won nothing in their history while Barcelona have won 13  Spanish league championships, 22 Spanish Cups, plus eight European crowns.
Should Deportivo carry off the title, it will be mainly thanks to 16-goal  Brazilian striker Bebeto, and the meanest defence in the league which has  conceded just 18 goals in 37 matches.
Barcelona were boosted by the happy outcome to the kidnapping of Romario's  father which allowed the Brazilian to concentrate on football.
Rio de Janeiro police freed him after a massive manhunt lasting six days.
Benfica cross the city to Sporting Lisbon in a top-of-the-table clash in  Portugal. Sporting, a point behind, will go top with four matches remaining if  they win.
Bobby Robson's Porto, three points behind Benfica, are away to  sixth-placed Vitoria Guimaraes.
Montpellier, who knocked out Olympique Marseille on their way to the  final, face Auxerre for the French Cup.
Montpellier beat Lens, conquerors of champions Paris St Germain, while  Auxerre beat Nantes in the semi-finals.
Montpellier won the Cup at their first attempt in 1990. Auxerre's only  appearance in the final was in 1979 when they were still in the second  division. They lost to Nantes after extra-time.

Italian Andrea Peron won the  eighth stage of the Tour DuPont cycle race on Thursday but Russian Viatcheslav  Ekimov kept a 34-second lead in the overall standings.
Peron, a 1992 Olympic time-trial silver medallist, broke away in the last  15 kilometers to win the 201-km stage from Banner Elk, North Carolina, in five  hours 35 minutes 47 seconds.
Briton Sean Yates was second in 5:36:37 and Djamolidin Abdujaparov of  Uzbekistan was third in 5:36:39.
Ekimov, the eight-time world track champion, finished eighth, in the same  time as American Lance Armstrong, who remained second in the overall standings.
"We controlled the race from the start and I'm satisfied," said Ekimov.  "But I don't know about the time trial. Lance and I have the same chance to  win, but it's short and flat, so it looks like my race."
Friday's ninth stage takes the field 214 kilometers to Charlotte North  Carolina.
The 12-day, 1,700-km race concludes Sunday in Winston-Salem, North  Carolina.
Armstrong, the world road racing champion, admitted that he would have  difficulty making up the gap to Ekimov, who is expected to dominate the  closing time trial on Sunday.
"There is a 90 percent chance he is going to win," Armstrong said. "My  only opportunity is if he cracks or something else happens."

The collapse of a three-million-dollar  bogus billing scam landed a former naval chief petty officer in jail here  Thursday.
James McGill, 53, sobbed and apologized to his family as US District Judge  John A. MacKenzie jailed him for seven years.
"I was selfish in what I did. I apologize to all of you," said McGill.
Authorities indicted McGill in January on 430 counts of filing false  claims, mail fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. He pleaded guilty in  February under an agreement with the government.
McGill, who was a supply clerk with 22 years in the navy, used his  knowledge of navy requistion methods to defraud the government. After leaving  the navy in 1981 he joined the merchant marines on Military Sealift Command  ships until he resigned in 1990.
In 1989 he began a scheme lasting four years, submitting false claims to  the navy for payment on supplies that were never ordered.
His ficticious company, Universal Supply and Services Inc., took in over 3  million dollars from the navy. He received over 100 checks ranging from 7,400  dollars to 60,000 dollars.
The scam fell apart when someone noticed he submitted requests for a ship  in storage.
McGill spent some of the money on gambling and opening a restaurant, but  gave most of it away to his church and friends. He agreed to repay the  remaining money.

More than 100 people have been  killed in the past two weeks in clashes between the two main Kurdish groups  which have split northern Iraq, leaders from both sides said.
The fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK of Jalal  Talabani) and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK of Massud Barzani) ended  early this week, they said.
The DPK has taken the control of the northwestern of Kurdistan around the  town of Dahuk, while the PUK had seized the southeast, around Sulaymaniyah, an  AFP correspondant said.
The two groups share with the Iraqi National Congress (INC) the province  of Arbil in the middle of the Kurdish-controlled area of northern Iraq.
The INC, which says it represents all the Kurdish and Arab factions  opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, brokered a ceasefire agreement on  Sunday. It is based in Salaheddin near Arbil.
The fighting erupted after a private quarrel, the PUK said.
The only clause of the ceasefire so far implemented provides for INC  militiamen to control checkpoints in the Arbil province, along with equal  numbers of PUK and DPK fighters.
INC official Kanaan Makkiya told AFP Moslem Shiite fighters from southern  Iraq were chosen to be deployed on the checkpoints.
The two remaining clauses of the May 8 agreement, that have not been yet  implemented, provide for prisoner exchanges and the handing back of captured  offices.
Makkiya said the PDK has given the INC, which is to supervise the  prisoners exchange, a list of 93 people were being held by the PUK.
A DPK official denied his group attacked the PUK in Dahuk. "We only  surrounded their offices to force them to surrender peacefully," he told AFP.
PUK spokesman Mohammad Tufic said his faction "has taken over" the DPK  offices in Sulaymaniyah only after its own offices in Dahuk were attacked.
Most of the casualties followed the PUK assault on Qalat Dizza and Raniya,  near the Iranian border, on May 2, sources from both parties said. Twelve were  killed in Sulaymaniyah and 12 in Salaheddin.
The official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Monday that 2,800 were  killed in the fighting.

The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve  have  neared agreement on plans to merge the Fed and three government agencies  to save money, said Fed Governor John LaWare Thursday.
The Treasury Department has estimated that the government could save 150  million to 200 million dollars annually and the banking industry about one  million if the Federal Reserve is merged with the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision and Comptroller of the Currency.
"There is substantially no difference between us and the Treasury on  this," said LaWare. "It's really just technicalities."
The Fed will continue to have oversight over 38 US banks under an accord  that the Treasury Department has seemed amenable to.
LaWare also seemed optimistic that the US Congress would lift the 1927  MacFadden Act, which requires banks that want to do business in several states  to set up wholly owned subsidiaries in each state in which they have branches.
The agreement, which has been approved by the Senate and House of  Representatives, could go into effect before the end of the year.
The single difference between the two versions is the treatment of foreign  banks, who have been asking for years to be given permission to operate here.
The senate would require them to create a US subsidiary while the House  would give them equal treatment with US banks.
US banks are currently lobbying for legislation that would require their  foreign competitors to set up subsidiaries here complete with boards of  directors -- putting them on the same footing as US banks who want to engage  in interstate trade.
The banks say that lifting the MacFadden Act would save 10 billion dollars  annually and make banking easier for the 60 million Americans living near  state borders.
LaWare also said he was opposed to a plan to strengthen regulations on  derivative products, financial instruments such as futures or options.
"Derivatives are not new, not mysterious and if managed properly like any  risk, not specifically dangerous," he said.
The Fed has not taken an official position on the issue.

Foreign evacuees airlifted from Sanaa by  the British Royal Air Force Thursday said people were deserting the capital of  war-torn Yemen and shortages were worsening.
Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreigners, most of them  British, to Cyprus from Sanaa. The evacuees, many looking exhausted, included  babies and young children.
They spent about two hours at Larnaca airport before boarding a British  Airways DC-10 plane bound for Gatwick airport, south of London.
Some had witnessed the fighting which erupted a week ago between northern  and southern forces and were in Sanaa when a Scud missile slammed into a  densely-populated area of the city Wednesday, causing at least 53 casualties.
Seventy-five evacuees arrived on one Hercules C-130 and 73 on the other.  The planes had flown into Sanaa from Djibouti earlier Thursday.
The group included about 20 Americans, as well as some Dutch, New  Zealanders, Swiss and Hungarians.
British construction worker Michael Wild said the blast from the Scud  missile which hit Sanaa Wednesday shattered windows in the hotel where he was  staying, 1,000 metres (yards) from the impact.
He quoted local Yemenis as saying 43 people were killed and 10 injured in  the attack, which flattened eight houses. Many of the victims were children.
The official news agency SABA said Wednesday 25 civilians were killed by  the Scud, fired by southern forces, and President Ali Abdallah Saleh put the  overall casualty toll at 53.
Wild added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) building in the  capital had been devastated in a northern attack and the Italian embassy was  also hit.
A Hungarian neurosurgeon who asked to be not named said "medical supplies  are extremely low" at the main Al-Thawra public hospital in Sanaa, where he  had been working.
He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were barely  functioning and virtually all the hospital's foreign staff -- mostly  Bulgarians and Indians -- had left.
About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few days ago.
The surgeon said some 15 Somali refugees caught in the crossfire were  admitted with serious bullet wounds, and "at least two of them died later."
The hospital was hit by electricity cuts and there was virtually no  maintenance, he said.
One of the Hercules pilots, Flight Lieutenant Nick Young, said  communications at Sanaa airport were "excellent" and praised the help offered  by the Yemeni authorities.
He said he saw no damage to the airport, despite reported bombing raids by  southern jets when the conflict erupted last week.
The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20 kilogrammes  (44 pounds) of luggage per person.
Yvonna Rienens, a Dutch teacher who was at an international school just  outside Sanaa, said 150 of the 200 teachers and pupils at the school had  already left.
She said she saw many Yemenis leaving Sanaa for villages outside the  capital, some with their goats, and carrying only a few personal belongings,  such as mattresses.
Oil engineers who were working for the US company Yemen Hunt Oil in the  Marib field east of Sanaa said about 200 oil workers had stayed behind to keep  operations at the field running. It produces up to 60,000 barrels of oil per  day.
Some of them said Sanaa appeared to be a "ghost town," with many shops  closed and long queues at petrol stations.
Veronica Pickton, a British tourist from Basingstoke in southern England,  said there were frequent electricity and water shortages at the hotel in Sanaa  where she had been staying for a week. However, there were "no signs of panic"  among local residents.
More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since fighting  erupted.
Britain earlier organised an evacuation of 225 non-Britons from Sanaa.
Around 800 Britons, mostly oil workers, lived in Yemen before the civil  war started. Some who were based around Aden, the southern capital, have  already been evacuated by sea.

A former member of the British elite SAS regiment  died from the effects of a bullet wound he received nearly 19 years before, a  coroner's inquest found Thursday.
Sergeant-major Tony Fleming was wounded in 1975 while his unit was aiding  the government of Oman against rebel forces. The bullet pierced his lung and  lodged in his spinal column, leaving him paralysed from the chest down.
Doctors gave him 10 years to live at most but he survived for almost twice  that, studying Arabic at university and returning to Oman to become a captain  of the sultanate's special forces.
He finally died of pneumonia in March after his condition suddenly  deteriorated. The inquest was held to establish that he had died of wounds  received on active service.

Telecom New Zealand announced a profit Friday  of 528.1 million NZ dollars (304 million US dollars) for the year ended March  31, up 15.4 percent from last year's 457.7 million dollars, excluding abnormal  restructuring costs.
Operating revenue was up 22.7 million dollars to 2.497 billion dollars.  This compared with a 53.3 million dollar decline in revenue the previous year.
Telecom cut its employee numbers by 25 percent during the year. Telecom's  operating expenses for the year were down 64.7 million dollars to 1.612  billion dollars, excluding abnormal restructuring costs.
The majority owner of Telecom is a consortium made up of Bell Atlantic and  Ameritech of the United States.

Malawi's provisional constitution will be voted  into law by parliament before next week's multi-party general elections.
Lovemore Munlo, chairman of the all-party National Consultative Council  (NCC) which is overseeing Malawi's transition to political pluralism, told  journalists here Thursday that parliament is likely to meet May 15 to endorse  the constitution.
Munlo, who is the country's attorney-general and justice minister, said  the constitution will come into force after the new government takes power  after the May 17 polls.
He said a parliamentary committee will collect and examine the public's  comments and criticism of the provisional constitution, and a definitive basic  law will be drawn up within a year.

The Senate defied President Bill Clinton on  Thursday by approving a measure that would require the United States to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia.
The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US  administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms  shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war.
Although the amendment, approved 50 to 49, has little chance of becoming  law, it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on  resolving the conflict.
Clinton has pressed for a multilateral lifting of the embargo but has  maintained that a unilateral effort by Washington could undermine other UN  actions around the world.
"The president really understands the Senate sentiment here," said White  House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. "He has opposed the arm embargo in Bosnia  from the beginning. We've pursued other options and as a result we've made  some progress on the ground in Bosnia."
But Myers said a unilateral lifting of the embargo could encourage other  countries to ignore UN sanctions on Serbia, North Korea and other nations.
The measure goes to the House of Representatives, where it was expected to  have little chance of passage. But even if it were approved, Clinton could  veto the measure, and a two-thirds majority of both houses would be needed to  override the veto.
Earlier, senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment  sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies  to lift the embargo. By placing the two amendments in the same bill, senators  appeared to give contradictory directives to the president.
---
"Lifting the arms embargo is the only feasible option that will permit the  Bosnian government to defend itself," said Senator Joseph Biden following the  vote on the bill.
State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said earlier that passing the  measure would be "problematic."
He also suggested it would send a conflicting message to Geneva, where  foreign ministers from Europe, Russia and the United States were to discuss  the Balkan conflict Friday.
Europe and Russia have argued that an end to the arms embargo would  escalate the fighting and quash any chance to resolve the conflict  diplomatically.
At the United Nations a diplomat said that the Security Council was  unlikely to approve a resolution lifting the embargo, noting that even if it  had a majority among the 15 members Russia would be sure to veto it.
China's UN representative, Chen Jian, said the US Senate action could  create new problems.
"China is not in favor of measures which could escalate the war. We could  judge against this background," the Beijing diplomat said.
Last year, a resolution introduced at the UN by Moslem and non-aligned  countries to exempt Bosnian Moslems from the sanctions won only six of the  nine votes necessary to pass. Five non-aligned members and the United States  supported the resolution.
Earlier Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,  said that lifting the arms embargo would not help efforts to bring peace to  Bosnia-Hercegovina after more than two years of brutal war.
"From a humanitarian point of view ... the number one objective I would  like to see achieved is a ceasefire. Number two is a political settlement,"  she said. "I hope all the meetings and decisions would lead to these two  objectives."
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic had appealed to members to pass the  bill, and thanked Dole and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman for introducing  it.
"The hopes of the Bosnian people are turned to the United States Senate,"  he said recently.

Police arrested some 50 people Thursday  after right-wing youths armed with knives and sticks chased foreigners through  the eastern German town of Magdeburg, injuring two of them seriously.
A 40-strong group of football fans attacked foreigners over several hours  after parading through the town centre giving Nazi salutes, a police spokesman  said.
"They indulged in a real hunt," the spokesman said.
Three of the foreigners, whose nationality was not specified, received  knife wounds and two were brought to a nearby hospital in a serious condition.
Two of the attackers were also lightly wounded and police were trying to  determine whether a sixth person injured, a German, was one of the aggressors.  A nightclub was seriously damaged during the fighting.
The extremists later attacked a cafe where their victims had taken shelter  before more than 200 police arrived on the scene, arresting both extremists  and foreigners, the spokesman said.
The entire police force had been placed on general alert during the  rampage, he added.
Extreme-right violence caused 22 deaths in Germany last year compared to  15 in 1992, but the number of attacks had dropped in the first few months of  this year.

Philadelphia first baseman John  Kruk, who missed the first six games of the season after surgery to remove a  cancerous testicle, will have an operation on his right knee on Friday.
Kruk will have arthoscopic surgery to remove loose cartilage from the  joint.
He is expected to miss the next three weeks.
"I couldn't move, I couldn't run," he said. "I wouldn't say it was  affecting the way I hit, but some people said I wasn't coming through on my  front side."
Kruk has averaged .313 with one home run this year. He said the cancer and  the knee problem had made it a tough season so far.
"I know my way around the hospital better than I do the stadium right  now," he said.

President Bill Clinton said will not rush into  choosing his next nominee to the Supreme Court as he missed the Thursday  target date he had set for the announcement.
The wait could signal a change in the Clinton's choices, with the  president possibly avoiding controversy over nominating Interior Secretary  Bruce Babbitt to the post.
Clinton said Tuesday he would make an announcement by Thursday, but the  only word Thursday was that he would hold off. He said he would resist "all  the pressure of time deadlines."
"On these matters," Clinton said, "I tend to keep my own counsel more than  on other things. ... It is one of the few things that the president just does  on his own, of course ultimately with the advice and consent of the Senate."
"I know that this has now become the most pressing story in the capital,  but this is really a story that will have implications for years, indeed  perhaps for decades to come," Clinton added.
Clinton's decision on his appointment to the highest court in the land is  now expected by Friday, giving time for the Senate to confirm his choice  before their summer recess.
Leaks -- particularly from senators consulted about possible candidates --  have indicated that Clinton has narrowed his choice to three names.
Named for life to the Supreme Court, the nine justices have a huge role in  determining the course of American society.
In recent decades, the court has ended segregation, given blacks political  power and legalized abortion, rulings which will have a lasting impact on the  country.
Clinton's hesitation is also due to the opposition the former Arizona  governor might face in his confirmation hearings in the Senate, where his  reputation as a staunch liberal and his political rather than legal background  could be liabilities.
The 55-year-old Babbitt has riled several members with his zealous efforts  to reform the government's management of the country's natural resources and  his crusade to put environmental concerns ahead of economic interests.

The two other leading candidates are both judges. Richard Arnold, who is  from Clinton's home state Arkansas, and Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts, are  both considered moderates.
"They would be slam dunks for the president," and easily confirmed said  Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee.
Arnold's health problems are an issue and also working against him is his  connection with Arkansas, where Clinton was governor. The White House wants to  avoid any hint of influence peddling.
Clinton's nominee will replace 85-year-old Justice Harry Blackmun who  decided to resign after 24 years on the Supreme Court.
Clinton named his first Supreme Court justice last June: Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, known as a moderate and an abortion rights advocate.

The White House said Thursday that the United  States and France had reached a "common approach" on Bosnia-Hercegovina, one  day before a Geneva meeting on the former Yugoslav republic.
In a brief statement, the White House said that President Bill Clinton and  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe "agreed the ministerial meeting offers as  an important opportunity for the US, France and the international community to  continue copperative efforts to press the parties to the conflict to negotiate  a political settlement."
Juppe arrived in Washington on Wednesday, determined to convince  Washington to force Bosnia's warring parties to agree to a peace plan.
"It is not a matter of imposing a peace plan on the parties that they  don't want but of putting pressure on them to accept it," he said.
Clinton on the other hand, had backed a plan to convince Europe to lift  the arms embargo on Bosnia's Moslems.
Juppe met with the president at the Oval office early Thursday to discuss  Bosnia.
Leaving the White House, Juppe said he was pleased with the "convergence"  between Washington and Paris, but he also acknowledged that there were stil   details to work out.
The Geneva conference Friday will bring together the foreign ministers of  Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, as well as Belgium and  Greece.

Two Nigerian soldiers were killed in the disputed  Bakassi peninsula in an incident blamed on Cameroon, Nigerian television  reported Thursday.
"Cameroon has once again confirmed that she is the aggressor," armed  forces spokesman Colonel Okon Ede was quoted as saying.
"While Nigeria has been playing the role of a good neighbour by resorting  to diplomatic, political and traditional means to resolve the dispute,  Cameroon has consistently displayed arrogant agression which resulted in the  death of two Nigerian soldiers recently."
Ede's statement, which gave no further details of the incident, called on  the international community to take note of "another veritable act of  provocation" by Cameroon.
Earlier the official Nigerian news agency said head of state General Sani  Abacha had held "crucial consultations" on national security with his armed  forces chiefs Thursday in the capital Abuja.
The situation in Bakassi, an area rich in natural resources where the two  sides have confronted each other since January, was one the agenda as well as  political and economic conditions in Nigeria, the agency said.

Telecom New Zealand Friday announced a profit  of 528.1 million NZ dollars (304 million US) for the year ended March 31, up  15.4 percent from last year's 457.7 million dollars, excluding abnormal  restructuring costs.
As the result was announced an academic said Telecom was making too much  money and might, as a result, attract attention from regulatory authorities.
Operating revenue was up 22.7 million dollars to 2.497 billion dollars.  This compared with a 53.3 million dollars decline in revenue the previous  year.
Telecom cut its employee numbers by 25 percent during the year. Telecom's  operating expenses for the year were down 64.7 million dollars to 1.612  billion dollars, excluding abnormal restructuring costs.
Staff shedding was reflected in gross personnel costs, which fell 11.6  percent over the year, and was the major factor in a 3.9 percent decline to  1.612 billion dollars in operating expenses.
At March 31 Telecom had 202 access lines per operating employee, compared  with 142 a year earlier and 123 in March 1992.
"The pace at which the number of personnel continues to decline will hinge  largely on the introduction of new systems, the timing of which is difficult  to forecast precisely," chairman Peter Shirtcliffe and chief executive  Roderick Deane said in their annual review.
About 1,000 more jobs are to be eliminated this financial year.
Meanwhile Victoria University professor of accounting Don Trow said  Friday's profit was too much for a near monopoly.
He said that if profits continued to grow, then the company is forecast to  reach more than 680 million dollars within two years, and the regulatory  Commerce Commission may be forced to consider the question of excessive  profits.
The return works out to more than 20 percent on investment, the highest  for any public company listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. At 680  million dollars that return grows to 30 percent; unheard of in a large company  in a country with low inflation.
Once state owned, Telecom is now half owned by two American companies,  Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, with the rest owned by small shareholders and New  Zealand and overseas fund managers.
Trow said the profit return was very high for a utility with secure cash  flows and profits unlikely to be badly affected by economic downturns.
He said Telecom was still in a position of substantial protection as its  main competitor, Clear Communications, had not yet had the chance to provide  effective competition in the local calling market.
Friday's result show revenue growth of 22.7 million dollars or 0.9 percent  compared with a 2.1 percent decline in the year ended March 1993.
The number of telephone access lines grew 3.8 percent, national call  volume 9.9 percent, international outward 11 percent and international inward  12.4 percent.
Directories and tariff revenue grew 13.1 percent and income from enhanced  services 23.6 percent.
The average of both national and outward international call prices in  March this year was around 15 percent lower than a year previously.
"The directors see significant prospects for growth in products and  services based on the capabilities of Telecom's intelligent network and modern  transmission systems," the annual review said.
"Market penetration and intensity of use of many of Telecom's products and  services, including toll calling, enhanced network services and mobile  services, are still low compared with other countries," it said.

In 33 years of racing, Emerson  Fittipaldi has never had an engine this good.
The reigning Indianapolis 500 champion gave the Mercedes power plant his  ultimate praise here Thursday after driving his Penske car to the month's  fastest lap in practice for the 78th Indy race.
The Brazilian circled the 2.5-mile (4 km) oval in 39.05 seconds at 230.438  mph (368.700 km/h). Fittipaldi reached a top speed of 245 mph (392 km/h).
"I've never been 245 mph before in my life," Fittipaldi said. "This is the  limit. Oh my. That must be a lot in kilometers. I don't want to even see it in  kilometers. I'll keep it in miles."
Fittipaldi's top speed replaced another Brazilian driver, Raul Boesel,  atop the Indy practice speed list. Boesel's best was 230.403 mph (368.644  km/h).
"We seem to be running in the same time slot more than anybody other than  the Penskes," Boesel said. "We have been consistent and we have a good balance  on the car."
Fittipaldi and his Mercedes-powered Roger Penske teammates, Al Unser Jnr  and Canada's Paul Tracy, are favorites in Saturday's 100,000-dollar pole  battle for the May 29 race. Fittipaldi won his only Indy pole in 1990, one  year after taking his first checkered flag at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
The Mercedes engine, designed by English motormakers Mario Illien and Paul  Morgan, takes advantage of extra boost allowed stock block engines. The rule  was aimed at allowing low-budget teams to be competitive here, but Penske's  multi million-dollar investment in an engine legal only here has made his cars  the ones to beat.
"The reality is there is much less of an advantage than people think,"  Fittipaldi said.
---
The advantage is enough for Ford motor racing director Dan Rivard to seek  relief from Indy race officials. Most contenders here use his Ford-Cosworth  engines across the Indy circuit, but Penske could make them uncompetitive.
"We're working with the speedway so we can all work with the same  engineering," Rivard said. "The speedway is faced with some very tough  choices. They have to make the decision (on changing rules to kill the  Mercedes)."
Rivard and Cosworth's Steve Miller both said they could build an Indy-only  engine similar to Mercedes for next year if they must. New rivals Honda and  Toyota would likely do the same.
"We're not adversarial in this, but we want to know what's going on,"  Rivard said. "If the Penskes have any luck at all, they could be unstoppable."
Even rivals agree the Mercedes drivers ae likely to break the track  records set by Roberto Guerrero in 1992. They are 232.482 mph (371.971 km/h)  for a four-lap average and 232.618 mph (372.188 km/h) for a single lap.
"It's going to be ludicrous. We're here to qualify in the second or third  row," Britain's Nigel Mansell said.
Unser, who has tested the Mercedes over 520 miles, dislikes the favored  role, saying: "We're not a lock for the pole. You can have all the horsepower  and it won't matter unless you can get around the corner."
But his father, four-time Indy winner Al Unser Sr., likes what he sees  from his son's engine.
"We know the engine is capable. Penske doesn't let things sit back and  relax," he said. "Whether it will stand up on race day, nobody knows. I bet  you it will be a strong motor all day, though. Penske wouldn't come here  without a good idea it would hold up."

A pro-Islamic lawyer, Abdel Hareth Madani, who died  in prison last week, had been tortured to death, an official preliminary  pathologist's report has found.
The office of the state prosecutor said it had called for a final report  and summoned the doctors who carried out the autopsy on Madani's body for more  information.
Prosecutor Raga'a al-Arabi, who ordered the pathologist's report, is also  expected to interrogate the police suspected of involvement in torturing  Madani.
Interior Minister General Hassan al-Alfi, questioned by journalists, said  the matter was still being investigated and that the truth would be made  public.
The Cairo Bar said Monday that Madani's death, notified to his family the  previous Friday, was premeditated murder, while Egyptian and foreign human  rights organisations called on President Hosni Mubarak to clear up the matter.
Madani was arrested on April 26 and taken away to an unknown destination.  The opposition said he had been trying to mediate between the government and  Islamic fundamentalists in the conflict which has killed some 400 people in  the past two years.

Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico cleared the way  Thursday for a three-way free trade agreement after settling several  longstanding differences, officials said.
In statements issued here as well as Caracas and Mexico City, the three  governments said the Group of Three treaty would be signed at the June 15  Latin American summit in the Colombian capital and would go into effect  January 1.
"This is a historic accord, the second most important in America," said  Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Rafael Santos, saying the pact was second in  importance only to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada, Mexico  and the United States.
Santos called the measure a definitive step toward the political  integration of Latin America.
To reach agreement, officials decided to exclude Venezuela from textile  and apparel, Santos said, adding that treatment of the petrochemical sector  was    handled on a product-by-product basis.
"We could not allow several differnces in secondary matters to sidetrack  this accord," Santos said.

Reduced costs and less stress are making  state officials consider more multiple executions after putting two prisoners  to death earlier in the week.
"The attorney general is talking to us now about the next multiple  execution," said Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Alan Ables  Thursday.
Convicted murderers Jonas Whitmore and Edward Charles Pickens died by  lethal injection Wednesday within about an hour of each other in the same  chamber.
Ables said more than one execution on one day saves money spent on  preparations and overtime.
He also said prison workers face less stress with multiple executions.  "Nobody wants to get up in the morning and go kill somebody," said Ables.
Two or more executions on the same date "would lessen that anxiety that  the officers are faced with," said Jim Clark, president of the International  Association of Correctional Officers in Washington.
"It should save the taxpayers a considerable amount of money and we  certainly encourage multiple executions," said Dennis Martin, executive  director of the National Association of Chiefs of Police.
Arkansas called in 32 extra state police to the prison Wednesday night  along with over 45 other people not normally on duty.
Multiple executions were once common in the United States. Arkansas  executed two people on four separate dates in 1960. Until Wednesday, no  multiple executions had taken place in the United States since the Supreme  Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
Executions are are becoming more frequent with prisoners convicted since  1976 reaching the end of their appeals. Whitmore and Pickens brought the death  total to 239 since 1977. More than 2,800 people are sitting on Death Row in  the United States.
The next multiple execution in Arkansas could take place in July or  August, said Ables. The state has 41 inmates on Death Row.

Chinese dissidents in the United States  generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing's privileged trading status  targeting state-owned firms, not complete revocation, dissident leaders said  here Thursday.
There are differing views among the dissident community in the United  States on the best way to advance human rights in China, but "an overwhelming  majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted revocation," Zhao Haiching,  the president of the National Council for Chinese Affairs (NCCA) told a press  conference.
China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human  rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if he were  to extend Beijing's most favored nation (MFN) trading status beyond June 3,  Zhao said.
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the  government's intransigence, said Zhao, whose group coordinates dissident  groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China.
Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned  enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its human  rights record, while not punishing the private sector and market economy which  everybody wants to promote, Zhao said.
Zhao also said it was the United States's own fault that its decision to  firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit.
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China "that all they have to  do to win MFN is play tough, and they have been doing so," Zhao said.
Economic officials in the government made it clear early that evoking  human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States.
Chinese dissident Wang Juntao, jailed for his part in the 1989  pro-democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square massacre, is  in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US officials.
Wang said that his release was a miracle, but urged the international  community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in  China. On Wedenesday, Wang called for Washington to aintain pressure on China  but not by withdrawing MFN
Wang met for half an hour at the White House with national security  adviser Anthony Lake, with no details available from the talks, officials said.

New York's Supreme Court upheld a lower court  decision Thursday denying film star Woody Allen custody of three children in a  bitter court battle with his ex-lover and former leading lady Mia Farrow.
The court also ordered Allen to pay 1.2 million dollars to cover Farrow's  legal expenses in the dispute over the couple's six-year-old biological son,  Satchel as well as two children adopted by the couple.
Elkan Abramowitz, Allen's lawyer, said the film director and actor was  "bitterly disappointed" by the ruling and said he may seek further appeals.
The appeals court ruled that Allen, who acknowledged sleeping with Soon-Yi  Previn, Farrow's 22-year-old adopted daughter, showed "an absence of any  parenting skill."
The court maintained an order barring Allen from visiting seven-year-old  Dylan and 16-year-old Moses, who were adopted by the couple during their  relationship that ended in 1992.
Allen was cleared of Farrow's accusations that he molested Dylan.

Rain, lightning and wild winds  wreaked havoc on the LPGA Championship Thursday, leaving two golfers, Alice  Ritzman and Dottie Mochrie, sharing the lead with three still stranded on the  course.
Ritzman has never won a tournament in 17 years on the LPGA Tour. She  carded a three-under 68 to share the lead with Dottie Mochrie, on a day in  which only 16 of 141 golfers carded par or better.
Golfers with early tee times played in the rain. Later thunderstorms  stopped play for two hours, and after the break strong, chilly winds caused  scores to balloon.
"I kind of weathered the storm," said Mochrie, who was on the last hole  when play was suspended. "It wasn't an easy day to play."
France's Anne-Marie Palli was disqualified for practicing during the rain  delay. Three other golfers withdrew: Nancy Lopez with a lower back injury,  Spain's Tania Abitbol with a wrist problem and Sandra Palmer after allergies  contributed to a disappointing 40 on her first nine holes.
Lopez, winner of three LPGA Championships, said she did not want to  jeopardize her season by playing through the injury.
"It was useless," said Lopez, who started on teh back nine with a bogey  and double bogey. "If I did keep swinging, it could have gotten worse. I want  to finish the rest of the year."
Mochrie remained steady in the face of the upheaval. She made 15 pars,  with birdies at five, 12, and 15.
"I think I played three different courses," she said. "The first holes in  downpour, then the wind, and then the storm. With all that, I'm pleased with  the way I played."
Ritzman, 42, got to 68 in different fashion. Opening on the back nine she  birdied the 11th and bogeyed the next from less than two feet.
She chipped in from 69 feet for a birdie at 17, and added three birdies  and a bogey on the front nine.
"The wind was strong and gusting," she said. "The conditions were pretty  tough. You had to maintain your patience to get the job done."
Juli Inkster and Noelle Daghe were one shot behind the leaders, and  England's Laura Davies was in a group of five on 70.
The three players still on the course when darkness fell were to complete  the round Friday morning.

The Senate should approve a 14-year-old treaty  to curb millions of landmines from being layed around world said President  Clinton Thursday.
Senate ratification would be "a matter of humanity, common sense and sound  military doctrine," Clinton said.
International representatives concluded the original agreement in Geneva  in the fall of 1980. The United States signed on in 1982. Since then the  treaty has languished, the subject of multiple US government reviews.
More than 100 million landmines lie unexploded in at least 62 countries,  human rights groups reported. They also said worldwide production may be  reaching 10 million anti-personnel landmines annually. The American Red Cross  reported landmines kill more than 200 civilians every week.
Landmines are a particular threat in Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia.
Clinton termed the treaty "a modest but significant humanitarian effort to  protect the victims of armed conflict from the effects of particular weapons."
He also said ratification would strengthen US efforts urging an  international moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines.
State Department and United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees  personnel will testify before the Senate Friday on the issue.

survey
WASHINGTON, May 12 (AFP) - Purchasing power of US households has been  rising and will continue to rise through the year 2000, the Conference Board  business research organization said Thursday.
Between 1960 and 1990, real per capita income doubled from 8,000 dollars  to 16,000 dollars a year, the board said.
"Frequent predictions of an emerging decline in US living standards have  little basis in fact," said Conference Board director Fabian Linden.
The survey found that a growing number of US households are joining the  middle class and that the 35-55 age group would soon control half the nation's  purchasing power.
The survey predicted that the number of households with an income level of  between 50,000 and 100,000 dollars annually will likely grow by one-third by  the end of the century and that the number of households earning more than  100,000 dollars would jump 80 percent.
Increased worker productivity, the greater participation of women in the  work force and increased levels of education were cited as factors for the  increase in purchasing power.

Nine alleged bank robbers and two  bystanders were killed when police foiled a bank robbery early Thursday,  leaving bodies strewn along a five-block stretch of road, authorities said.
The bank robbers entered a Banco de Colombia branch and took about 20,000  dollars before they were surprised by police.
Police and the alleged bank robbers exchanged fire, and the nine were shot  and killed as they attempted to flee.
The dead included two passersby: a taxi driver allegedly shot by the bank  robbers as they attempted to steal his vehicle and a bystander, police  spokesmen said.

Pioneer psychoanalyst Erik Erikson  who widened the scope of psychoanalytic theory to take greater account of  social, cultural and other environmental factors, died Thursday. He was 91.
Erikson died at the Rosewood Manor Nursing Home, said Diana Eck, a Harvard  professor and friend.
"As they used to say of Gandhi, he was a mahatma, a great soul, very wise,  very wide-ranging humanist and someone who really illuminated the stages of  the life cycle from birth to death," Eck said.
Erikson trained under Anna Freud -- the daughter of Sigmund Freud --  specializing in child pyschology. Erikson graduated from the Vienna  Psychoanalytic Institute.
He extended Freudian theory into adolescence and adulthood and coined the  phrase, "identity crisis."
He wrote numerous books on human development and was recognized in his  field as a pioneer. His most influential book was "Childhood and Society"  (1950).
His psychohistorical studies, "Young Man Luther" (1958) and "Gandhi's  Truth" (1969), explored the convergence of personal development and social  history. The latter won the Pulitzer and National Book Award in 1970. Later  works dealt with ethical concerns in the modern world.
In addition to psychoanalytic works, Erikson also wrote biographies of  Jesus, Albert Einstein, William James and Charles Darwin.
Born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on June 15, 1902 to Danish parents,  Erikson left Europe for the United States in 1933. He became a naturalized US  citizen in 1939.
Erikson taught at Harvard University in the mid-1930s and returned during  the 1960s. He was professor emeritus of human development and psychiatry at  Harvard.
In his last years he had been living at the nursing home. His wife, Joan,  lived nearby.

Diplomats from Europe, Russia and the United States  prepared to meet here Friday amid disarray for yet another attempt to get to  grips with the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
A senior US official said the aim was to "focus on cessation of  hostilities linked with an early resumption of negotiations" between the  Bosnian Serbs and the recently-agreed Moslem-Croat federation.
But he acknowledged that the Serbs were demanding a lifting of UN  sanctions against their backers in the rump Yugoslavia before they would  return to the negotiating table, something which the United States opposes.
Washington, represented by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, also  went into the talks embarrassed by a vote Thursday by the US Senate that the  administration should unilaterally allow US arms shipments to the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian government in defiance of a 1991 UN embargo.
US President Bill Clinton favours lifting the embargo to allow the  government forces to defend themselves, but says it must be a multilateral  move. The Senate vote, while having virtually no chance of becoming law,  undercut him the day before the Geneva talks.
Friday's conference also follows strong words from France that it might be  obliged to pull its forces out of the UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia if  peace can not be obtained, and continuing disagreement over how territory  might be divided among the warring sides.
But despite earlier pessimism from Washington, the US official here said  it was "possible to a large extent" to "agree on some kind of approach"  towards resolving the problem.
He said that both sides had indicated interest in a cessation of  hostilities, the Serbs because of the 70 percent of Bosnia they controlled was  "more they can effectively occupy," and the Sarajevo government because it  wanted to "calm things down in the hope negotiations resume."
The official said the Geneva conference should also reaffirm support for  decisions on the six UN-declared safe areas and prevent offensive actions  elsewhere.
On Thursday fighting was reported at Tuzla and Bihac, both declared safe  areas, and at Brcko, a potential flashpoint, while a UN military observer was  killed and another seriously wounded on the edge of the Sarajevo exclusion  zone.
UN Secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali called Thursday in a statement  published in New York for the boundaries of the safe areas, where Moslems are  under siege from Serbs, to be clearly defined.
He also ruled out extending the safe areas, for example to Brcko, saying  the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) did not have the resources to cover them.
"It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a  long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina,  which requires a political and territorial solution," Boutros-Ghali added.
The UN chief met in Paris Thursday with civilian and military chiefs  operating in the former Yugoslavia, including special representative Yasushi  Akashi, UNPROFOR commander General Bertrand de Lapresle, peace negotiator  Thorvald Stoltenberg and his European Union colleague Lord Owen.
The meeting covered Stoltenberg and Owen's mandate for the Geneva talks,  as well as ways of improving communications between UNPROFOR, Boutros-Ghali  and the UN Security Council.
A communique said the UN wanted to see the participants at Geneva agree at  least on the need to establish a general ceasefire in Bosnia as soon as  possible and to deal with the whole problem of the conflict on a global and  not a piecemeal basis.
Questioned on the possibility of lifting UN sanctions against Belgrade,  held responsible for inciting the conflict, to encourage the Serbs to return  to the negotiating table, the US official said this could begin once the Serbs  had made a verified withdrawal of their forces to agreed lines.
As well as Christopher, Owen and Stoltenberg, the Geneva conference brings  together the foreign ministers of Russia and five from the European Union:  Britain and France which have the largest contingents of peacekeepers in  Bosnia, current president of the council of ministers Greece, its predecessor  Belgium and its successor Germany.
Saturday sees the signature of the agreement between Bosnian Croats and  Moslems on their federation, which the Serbs have refused to join. The  federation has also caused unease by claiming 58 percent of  Bosnia-Hercegovina, more than the Geneva participants have been prepared to  agree.

Japan's women's volleyball team launched  their tour of the United States with a 3-0 victory Thursday night, taking  their record against the Americans to 88-57.
Japan cruised to a 15-5, 15-10, 15-5 sweep in front of about 3,000 fans.
Mika Yamauchi led Japan with 19 kills and two blocks. Teammate Kazuyo  Matsukawa added 12 kills and five blocks in the winning effort.
The four-city tour continues Friday in Kansas City, Missouri. The two  countries play in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Sunday and Denver, Colorado, on Monday.

Six adults and two children died early Friday when  fire swept through a furniture factory and salesroom in northern Bangkok,  trapping the victims in their second-storey living quarters, police said.
Iron grilles on doors and windows prevented the victims from escaping the  blaze, police said.
Radio reports said 10 workers managed to escape, but police could not  immediately confirm the figure.
The cause of the fire, which broke out at around 1:30 a.m. and raged for  over an hour, was under investigation, police said.

The film censorship board has decided that the  Oscar-winning film "Schindler's List" may be shown uncut in Thai theaters  despite nude love-making scenes which contravene local regulations.
The board voted Thursday to lift a ban imposed earlier this month, and the  film will be shown for the first time in Bangkok Saturday, a spokesman for  distributors United International Pictures, Surachit Chanowan, said.
In a 6-4 vote after hours of debate, the board decided that a 10-second  nude sex scene was not after all objectionable as no sex organs were shown and  it did not provoke sexual excitement, a police official told AFP Friday.
The official noted that board members voting against showing the film  uncut included the press association, despite recent calls in the local press  to update Thailand's 1920s-era censorship regulations.
Others voting against represented the defense ministry, the national  intelligence agency and the Thai movie confederation, the official said.
Steven Spielberg's epic of a German industrialist who smuggles more than  1,000 Jews to safety during World War II, winner of seven Academy Awards, ran  into trouble in several countries when Spielberg refused to allow any cuts.
Malaysia banned "Schindler's List," then grudgingly relented. The  Philippines censorship board voted to cut certain scenes until President Fidel  Ramos issued a decree to show the film in its entirety.
Indonesia, where some Moslem organizations contend the film demonstrates  morals and actions which run counter to the Indonesian way of life, remains  undecided.
In Thailand, where explicit sex shows can be seen in many night spots,  films are routinely cut to meet censorship standards or a 90-minute time  frame. Scenes of violence generally escape the cuts, but scenes with nudity do  not.
Another Oscar-winning film now making the rounds in Bangkok, "The Piano",  is being shown at its full length, but with scenes involving nudity smeared  into obscurity with petroleum jelly.

The Atlanta Hawks held Indiana to the  lowest points total ever in a National Basketball Association playoff game  Thursday, leveling their second-round series 1-1 with a 92-69 victory.
The Pacers' 69 points were one less than the previous playoff low of 70,  set by Golden State against Los Angeles in 1973 and matched by Seattle against  Houston in 1982.
Atlanta's Mookie Blaylock posted 11 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds --  hitting double digits in all three categories for the fourth time in his  career.
Atlanta led by as much as 61-42 at one point in the third quarter. Indiana  narrowed the gap to 65-57 but could not come any closer.
The Hawks led from late in the first quarter, when Kevin Willis' shot from  the corner broke a 19-19 tie. Atlanta led 47-32 at halftime.
The best-of-seven series moves to Indianapolis, Indiana, for game three on  Saturday.

Venezuela's Supreme Court cleared the way Thursday  for a second set of charges to be filed against former president Jaime  Lusinchi (1984-1989), chief justice Roberto Yepez Boscan announced.
The high court found that there was enough evidence to try Lusinchi,a  social democrat, for misappropriation of funds from the National Institute of  Racecourses, an agency to manage racetracks.
The next step would be for the court to ask congress to lift Lusinchi's  presidential immunity, said Yepez Boscan. Lusinchi, like all ex-presidents,  has a lifetime seat in the senate.
The Supreme Court ruled in August that there was enough evidence to try  Lusinchi for corruption in his handling of other state funds. That trial is  now in "judicial limbo," said Lusinchi's lawyer, Morris Sierralta.
Lusinchi is currently in Boston, Massachusetts, according to his attorney.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin has issued an  ominous warning that stability will be maintained at any cost, defending the  bloody suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy movement just weeks before its  fifth anniversary.
Without the "resolute measures" taken by the army on June 4, China would  not enjoy its current stability, said Jiang, whose remarks were carried on  state-run radio and the front pages of all major newspapers Friday.
By invoking the memory of June 4, Jiang has issued the strongest warning  to date that the government is willing to take all measures necessary --  including military force -- to eliminate any perceived threat to its position.
Since the beginning of the year, Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed  the paramount importance of stability and their rhetoric has been backed up by  widespread arrests of dissidents and a law and order crackdown that has seen a  sharp increase in executions.
Jiang made the comments during a meeting here Thursday with visiting  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammad.
"A bad thing has been turned into a good thing," Jiang said, referring to  the 1989 unrest that at its height saw upwards of one million people taking to  the streets of Beijing in a single day.
"As a result, our reform and opening programme has forged ahead with  steadier, better and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought  into fuller play," Jiang said.
Jiang was communist party chief in Shanghai at the time of the Tiananmen  Square massacre and consequently emerged untainted by its bloody aftermath,  which makes his unequivocal endorsement of the military supression all the  more significant.
As well as the presidency, Jiang currently hold the posts of Communist  Party secretary general and chairman of the powerful Central Military  Commission.

Israeli officials handed over  at least three buildings to Palestinian police officers in the early hours of  Friday as a small crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the  central police station, the post office and a court house. The sites were  transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed over from Jordan on  Thursday.

Israeli officials handed over  at least three buildings to Palestinian police officers in the early hours of  Friday as a small crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the  central police station, the post office and a court house, witnesses said.
The sites were transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed  over from Jordan on Thursday.
Another 40 officers and 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, are due to  follow on Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town to  the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
"If all goes well, all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by  Friday afternoon," said Colonel Herzl, a member of the Israeli-Palestinian  military liaison commmittee, whose full name was withheld for security  reasons.
"I didn't expect them to hand over the sites this quiet way," said  taxi-driver Attia Barham, 40.
"But there have been so many changes in plans that I'm not surprised.
"The Israelis saw how happy we were and didn't want to let us rejoice," he  said, referring to the discreet way the officers were let in to the region.

India's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes  will top Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's agenda on his visit to the United  States, his most controversial foreign trip in three years in office.
The 73-year-old Indian leader, who embarks on the visit Saturday, is under  tremendous domestic pressure to stand up to persistent US demands to cap the  country's nuclear regime and freeze its missile defence programme.
Opposition leaders have urged him to call off the visit to denounce what  they describe as US arm-twisting over the nuclear issue, Kashmir, human rights  and trade.
No overseas visit by Rao has generated so much heat and controversy.
Both Indian officials and US diplomats admit that the two countries have  never been so far apart on crucial policy issues, but emphasise that the trip  is nevertheless important to set the course for future ties.
"There are some issues on which we agree, there are some on which we have  differences," a US diplomat here said, underlining the growing chasm. "We  shall try to find a common agenda."
On Thursday, Rao indicated that a common ground would be hard to find when  he vowed not to roll back India's nuclear and missile policies under pressure  from Washington.
"A leader would be worthless if he changes government policies during his  visits to a foreign country," he told a meeting of MPs from his ruling  Congress (I) party.
Rao is under widespread attack that he has already bowed to Washington by  postponing the final trial of India's surface-to-surface Prithvi missile that  had been scheduled for Saturday.
A day's secret talks between Indian and US officials in London last month  on the nuclear programme added to rumours that Rao may be quietly preparing to  surrender India's nuclear option.
Commentator Nikhil Chakravarty said on Thursday in an article titled "Mr.  Rao, go to Washington but go with dignity" that the week-long visit "looks as  onerous as climbing Mount Everest."
At the root of Indo-US differences is the refusal by New Delhi, which  exploded a nuclear device in 1974, to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) or agree to a pact on a nuclear-free South Asia.
Indian officials with an eye on China say any attempt at nuclear  disarmament should be global and not restricted to a region.
The US administration, which fears that South Asia is a potential nuclear  flashpoint, also wants New Delhi not to induct the Prithvi missile into the  army, and to halt research on the intermediate-range Agni ballistic missile.
The demands, on top of statements by US officials seen here as tacitly  encouraging the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir, have angered many in India,  where the US is still widely seen as pro-Pakistan.
A US proposal to supply 38 F-16 planes to Pakistan, with which India has  fought three wars and which it accuses of backing Moslem separatism in  Kashmir, has added to the list of irritants.
The strains were evident on May 7 when the Indian foreign ministry, in a  move unprecedented ahead of a prime minister's visit, lashed out at Washington.
"India is equally disappointed that the US approach has not accepted  India's position (on nuclear non-proliferation) and persists with its  'all-or-nothing' approach," a spokesman said.
The American attempt to cap the country's nuclear program "is bound to  fail," said Brajesh Mishra of the oppostion Indian's People's Party. "The  prime minister is in no position to compromise in view of the overwhelming  mood in the country."
Amid the fireworks, Indian officials say they will try to sell New Delhi's  three-year-old economic reforms which have made the country an attractive  investment centre, in particular for US companies.

Indonesian dissidents are either worried or  outright indignant over this week's announcement that state security forces  would become more involved in labour disputes.
The head of the army's powerful social and political division, General  Hartono, announced that the National Coordinating Agency for the Maintenance  of National Stability (Bakorstanas) would become involved in social conflicts  from their outset to prevent them from spinning out of control.
In mid-April, strikes in the North Sumatran city of Medan degenerated into  demonstrations against the country's ethnic Chinese, in which one person was  killed amidst widespread property damage.
On Tuesday Hartono criticised Indonesia's official trade union, the SPSI  (Indonesian Workers Union), saying it had failed in its mission to defend the  country's workers.
His remarks were not welcomed by the president of the independent  Prosperity union (officially called the SBSI), Mukhtar Pakpahan: "I think this  move will not overcome the problem. The root of the labour dispute in  Indonesia is because there is no freedom for workers to organise themselves,"  he said.
"This involvement by Bakorstanas or the army is a step backwards," he  added.
Founded in 1992, Prosperity is not recognised by the government, which  prefers to deal with the official SPSI only.
Accused by the army of being behind the rioting in Medan, Prosperity has  seen its freedom of movement further curtailed ever since. Three of its local  officials have been arrested, and another twenty activists have been detained.
"The move is also against our law. Even the ministerial decree which  allows the intervention of the military to a labour dispute has been scrapped  by the introduction of new ministerial decree number 15/1994 at the beginning  of the year," Pakpahan said.
"It will also protect the interest of the businessman and it leads to a  militarisation," he said.
The new measure was also denounced by the co-founder of another  independent union, "Solidarity" (Setiakawan) -- older than Prosperity but now  lapsed -- human rights activist Johanes Princen.
"In the first place, the army should lower the informal cost that you have  to pay to the manpower ministry, the military, the police, the mayor of the  city, the people of the industry ministry, etcetera," he said, alluding to  what he says are the numerous bribes employers have to pay the authorities  here.
"We all know that it does exist," he said. "The informal costs have to  disappear. The profit could then go in part to the labour."
Hartono defended the new involvement of Bakorstanas, calling it part of a  legitimate concern for the stability of the country.
"If they are not coordinated from the outset, social problems could  increase and get out of hand ... they could become violent and then require  even more difficult measures," he said.
Observers here said that Hartono's carefully prepared remarks, which were  read to a seminar here and then given widespread publicity in the national  media the next day, were a reflection of the military establishment's concern  with the subject.
The Medan demonstrators were demanding to be paid minimum wage, which is  around the equivalent of 1.50 dollars a day. But many employers ignore the  law, even according to the government of president Suharto.

Six Malaysians were hanged here Friday for drug  trafficking, Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said.
The six, convicted of trafficking cannabis and heroin and helping others  to do so, went to the gallows at Singapore's Changi Prison at dawn.
Under local laws, the death sentence is mandatory for those convicted of  trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin, 500 grams of cannabis or abetting in  such offences.
Almost similar laws are enforced in Malaysia.
The CNB said that the hangings raised to 59 the number of people executed  for drug-related offences under Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act which   introduced the death penalty for trafficking in 1975.

Australia announced Friday it had won a  multi-million dollar contract to train 60 Vietnamese pilots to aid that  country's air safety and tourism.
The two-year nine-million-Australian-dollar (6.5-million-US) contract was  sealed by national flag-carrier Qantas and the Australian Aviation College of  Adelaide, South Australia.
"This is a tremendous boost for Australia's aviation industry and for  South Australia," said Gordon Bilney, minister for development cooperation.
"This project will raise the Australian aviation industry's international  profile, especially in Southeast Asia, one of the world's most important  emerging markets."
Training would boost Vientamese air safety and tourism, Bilney said in a  statement.
Vietnam planned to upgrade its current fleet of aging Soviet aircraft and  leased modern aircraft from Western countries, Bilney said, and wanted to  train its own pilots to take over from those currently on contract from  overseas.
The aviation college had already trained 677 pilots of whom 570 were from  developing countries including China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,  the Solomon Islands, South Korea and Oman.
The first Vietnamese trainee pilots were due to arrive in June.

Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii denied  Friday a news report that a "secret accord" to stop the dollar's fall had been  reached late April at a meeting of central bankers and finance ministers from  the Group of Seven (G7).
"There was no such accord," Fujii told a scheduled press conference.
Quoting unidentified international financial sources, the Mainichi  newspaper said Friday that the G7 agreed at the meeting in Washington to  maintain the dollar above the "psychologically important" 100-yen line against  the yen.
They decided to take action together to defend the dollar, partly in  response to a strong US request, the daily said.
Commenting on the currently stable dollar-yen exchange, Fujii said it  "reflected a basic idea of G7 nations closely contacting each other, based on  a view that sharp movements in one country's currency is undesirable."
The dollar opened at 104.15 yen in Tokyo on Friday, up 0.05 yen from the  previous day's finish of 104.10 yen.
The opening rate was slightly below New York's late Thursday quote of  104.22 yen.
The Group of Seven comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan and the United States.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has  criticised Lisbon for lax security for 41 pro-Indonesian East Timorese  pilgrims visiting Portugal, the Antara news agency said Friday.
The group was pelted with rotten eggs and garbage by a jeering crowd on  arrival at Lisbon airport Tuesday. Its leader, roving ambassador Lopez da  Cruz, was called a traitor and murderer.
The group is making a pilgrimage to the Catholic shrine of Fatima.
"I am surprised such an incident could not have been prevented by the  local security," Antara quoted Alatas as telling journalists Thursday.
He said if that was how Portugal welcomed a group from Indonesia visiting  in the framework of confidence-building measures, then Jakarta would think  twice before allowing any more such visits.
The incident came a few days after Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart  Durao Barroso met in Geneva for a new round of talks under the auspices of UN  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to try to find an acceptable solution  to the question of East Timor.
Indonesia invaded East Timor on December 1975 and unilaterally declared  the former Portuguese colony its 27th province in 1976. The United Nations  still recognizes Lisbon as the administrator of the territory.
Portugal severed ties with Indonesia shortly after the Indonesian troops  entered East Timor.

Japan will send two senior officials to the United  States next week in a bid to break the impasse in talks on bilateral trade,  International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday.
He told a press conference that the officials to be sent to Washington are  Sozaburo Okamatsu, his deputy for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi,  deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.

China has appointed 13 more members to its  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) -- Beijing's shadow policy-making body in  Hong Kong.
The PWC is charged with mapping out Hong Kong's post-1997 political system  in conjunction with top Beijing officials led by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
The latest appointments, which include businessmen, former government  officials, and academicians from Hong Kong, were made Thursday after the  seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of China's National People's  Congress in Beijing, the semi-official China News Service said.
They included businessman Paul Cheng, chairman of Inchcape Pacific, a  subsidiary of British-owned Inchcape PLC, and former chairman of the Hong Kong  Chamber of Commerce, Wong Ying-wai, former deputy trade and industry  director-general, and Arthur Garcia, a former government ombudsman.
New PWC members from the Chinese side included Guo Fengmin, the Chinese  team leader of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, and Wulan Mulun, the  deputy director of Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong.
Beijing has now handpicked 141 advisers from the territory to help it  prepare for the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.
Beijing set up the PWC and advisory bodies after Governor Chris Patten  ignored Chinese objections and pushed ahead with political reforms for Hong  Kong ahead of 1997.

Philippine Vice President Joseph Estrada Friday  asked local organizers of a controversial East Timor conference to hold it  abroad so the Philippines could avoid a diplomatic rift with Indonesia.
"Let us not invite unnecessary irritants to this relationship. Moving the  conference out of the country is for the larger national interest," said a  statement issued by Estrada's office.
Estrada recently returned from Johannesburg where he had attended the  inauguration of the new South African government.
While in South Africa he met Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to  distance Manila from the May 31-June 2 meeting, organized by activist groups  here, European jurists and exiled Fretilin rebels.
"While we respect the human rights issue, the holding of the conference is  untimely because of the ongoing peace talks in Indonesia," Estrada said,  referring to Jakarta's sponsorship of peace negotiations between the  Philippine government and Moslem guerrillas.
But the local organizers said the conference, intended to expose Jakarta's  human rights record in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, would go  ahead despite the abrupt and unexplained withdrawal of French First Lady  Danielle Mitterrand, who was to have delivered the keynote address.
President Fidel Ramos said Wednesday that bilateral ties were strong  enough to withstand such "irritants," but stressed that it would be  unconstitutional for Manila to try to stop the holding of the conference.

The navies of Japan and South Korea will hold their   first exercises together when they take part in US-led "Rimpac" maneuvers in  the Pacific Ocean from May 26, the Defense Ministry announced Friday.
This will be South Korea's third time participating in the biennial  exercise, "Rimpac," since 1990, but its first time conducting maritime  exercises with Japan, a ministry spokesman said.
The exercises will be staged in the West and Mid-Pacific region from May  26 through July 16 by the navies of the United States, Australia, Canada,  Japan and South Korea to secure maritime transportation routes and promote  combined operational capabilities, he said.
South Korea will send two escort destroyers and 360 men for the maneuvers,  which involve two aircraft carriers, 58 other vessels, 200 aircraft and 25,000  crew members, he said.
The United States, Japan and South Korea will jointly conduct  "offensive-defensive battle maneuvers," including gunfire exercises and guided  missile and torpedo firing, the ministry said.
In the three-nation exercise, however, US vessels will form two separate   training units, one with South Korea and another with Japan because Japan's  post-war constitution allows it to take part in international exercises only  within the framework of its bilateral security pact with Washington, it said.
US ships will also lead a second task force with Canada and Australia, the  ministry said, without elaborating on the schedule.

Hong Kong's airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.,  will hold another round of talks with disgruntled pilots over pay rises on May  23, an airline spokesman said Friday.
Talks between management and the Aircrew Officers' Association (AOA) ended  Thursday without agreement in a dispute over pay and productivity.
Airline spokesman Phil Burfurd said pilots had been briefed on changes in  service conditions at Thursday's meeting. "We are happy to give a pay rise but  it must be accompanied by increased productivity" to maintain profitability,  he said.
Cathay earlier had offered a five percent pay raise which the pilots  rejected. The AOA represents about 90 percent of Cathay's 1,200 pilots and  flight engineers.
Cathay has already reached agreements with the Flight Attendants Union and  the Local Staff Union, increasing wages by five and eight percent respectively.
A first officer has a starting salary of 21,000 Hong Kong dollars (2,691  US) per month, while senior captains can get as much as 158,000 dollars  (20,256 US) plus housing, education and travel benefits.
Cathay Pacific reported in March its profits had fallen 23.8 percent to  2.293 billion dollars (294 million US) due to inflation in Hong Kong and a  costly flight attendants' strike last year.

A Chinese court has sentenced two US citizens to  prison terms of 20 and 14 years for their part in a major fraud case,  involving letters of credit totalling some 10 billion dollars, Xinhua said  Friday.
Hung Moy and Raymond Lee, both Chinese-Americans were sentenced to 20 and  14 years respectively by a court in the northern province of Hebei, the  official news agency said.
A local Agricultural Bank of China official was sentenced to 11 years for  "revealing state secrets" as part of the swindle.

Australia and a number of other countries are  considering increased military aid to bolster and restructure Cambodian forces  to help them fight the far-left Khmer Rouge, officials in Canberra said Friday.
France, the United States and some Asian countries are said to be  discussing the most appropriate form of assistance because of the growing fear  the Cambodian goverment is incapable of properly defending itself against a  more disciplined Marxist guerilla force.
But Thailand would not be involved and has actually warned Australia to  stay out of Cambodia, one official said.
Although Australia is a major supporter of Cambodia -- last month doubling  its aid package to 92 million dollars (66 million US) -- current military aid  is minimal and mainly focused on mine clearance and naval training.
"We are looking at military assistance," a foreign affairs department  official said. "But whether that package is training, material or whatever has  yet to be determined."
"There would need to be assurances that what was being provided if any was  properly utilised, not sold off, that they are going to take care of it and  that the structure of the army is improved to the extent that they would  become more competent and be able to use that equipment more effectively."
"The Khmer Rouge are still active, still being obtrusive and while it is  judged that they do not have the capacity to overthrow the Royal Cambodian  government they continue to be an ongoing thorn in their side."
This was preventing Cambodia from being able to move on to developmental  work it had hoped to start after last year's election.
Thailand had made clear to Australia its view that no other country should  be involved in providing military assistance to Cambodia, which Bangkok  believes should fight its own battles, the official said.
But Australia, which played a key role in developing the Paris accords  that brought a measure of democracy and for a time relative peace to Cambodia  does not intend to play a leading role in countering the Khmer Rouge.
Its talks with other countries are focused on strengthening the capacity  ofCambodian forces.
"I dont think any country wants to step out ahead and take the lead, partly  because the Paris accords prevent that to a certain extent," the official  said.
"Equally, I dont think any country realistically wants to take on that  level of responsibility so the approach would be a concerted one."
King Norodom Sihanouk, speaking after a series of reversals for the  Cambodian government forces against the ultra-left guerrillas, expressed  despair Thursday for his country's future, and said military aid seemed to be  only solution.
But he has also admitted to the widespread problems of indiscipline and  corruption within the army's ranks.

Taiwan is to cut tariffs on 758 items, about  one-third of them agricultural products, by an average of 2.81 percent to  promote free trade and boost its chance of being admitted to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT,) financial officials said Friday.
The cabinet Thursday approved a revised tariff schedule reducing import  duties on 514 industrial goods and 244 farm products as proposed by the  ministries of finance and economic affairs, the officials said.
The rates would become effective after endorsement by parliament, they  said.
Average tariffs on the affected industrial items would be lowered from  6.52 percent to 6.38 percent, while those on the agricultural goods would be  cut from 21.64 percent to 20.79 percent.
The liberalization move, aiming to stimulate domestic industries and buoy  Taiwan's position in consultation talks with GATT member countries over the  country's bid to join the world body, the officials said.
The tariff reductions would cost 94.3 million dollars in custom revenues,  they added.
Fruits, vegetables, juice, beef and marine products were among the  affected agricultural imports while general consumer goods such as cosmetics  and home electrical appliances would also enjoy lower rates, they said.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin has issued an  ominous warning that stability will be maintained at any cost, defending the  bloody suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy movement just weeks before its  fifth anniversary.
Without the "resolute measures" taken by the army on June 4, China would  not enjoy its current stability, said Jiang, whose remarks were carried on  state-run radio and the front pages of all major newspapers Friday.
By invoking the memory of June 4, Jiang has issued the strongest warning  to date that the government is willing to take all measures necessary --  including military force -- to eliminate any perceived threat to its position.
Since the beginning of the year, Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed  the paramount importance of stability and their rhetoric has been backed up by  widespread arrests of dissidents and a law and order crackdown that has seen a  sharp increase in executions.
Jiang made the comments during a meeting here Thursday with visiting  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad.
"A bad thing has been turned into a good thing," Jiang said, referring to  the 1989 unrest that at its height saw upwards of one million people taking to  the streets of Beijing in a single day.
"As a result, our reform and opening programme has forged ahead with  steadier, better and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought  into fuller play," Jiang said.
Jiang was communist party chief in Shanghai at the time of the Tiananmen  Square massacre and consequently emerged untainted by its bloody aftermath,  which makes his unequivocal endorsement of the military supression all the  more significant, according to analysts here.
"This is 100 percent a warning to anyone considering any open action to  mark the upcoming anniversary," a western diplomat said.
In the last six months, dozens of dissidents have been arrested across  China, effectively neutering prominent pro-democracy groups in Beijing,  Shanghai and the central city of Xian.
China's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng is currently in detention  and could face fresh criminal charges.
"It is certainly the most explicit reference by a Chinese leader to June 4  in the past few years, and the fact that Jiang was the mouthpiece underscores  the severity of the message."
As well as the presidency, Jiang currently hold the posts of Communist  Party secretary general and chairman of the powerful Central Military  Commission.
"History shows that anything conducive to out national stability is good,"  Jiang told the Malaysian premier.
"In the past five years, China has enjoyed economic development, social  stability and improved the livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent  efforts to take stability as an overriding priority," Jiang said.
"Facts prove this is absolutely correct."
The fear of social unrest has dominated policy at the very heart of the  Chinese leadership since the launch at the beginning of the year of  far-reaching economic reforms that have fuelled inflation and regional  economic disparities.
"While Jiang's timing reflects concern over the Tiananmen anniversary,  there is also clearly an implied general warning that the government will not  allow discontent to derail the reform process," the western diplomat said.
The authorities are especially concerned that rumblings in the countryside  over rising prices and low incomes could develop into a major challenge to the  communist party's rural base.

A Chinese court has sentenced two US citizens to  prison terms of 20 and 14 years for their part in a major fraud case,  involving letters of credit totalling some 10 billion dollars, Xinhua said  Friday.
Francisco Hung Moy and Raymond Lee, both Chinese-Americans, were sentenced  to 20 and 14 years respectively by a court in the northern province of Hebei,  the official news agency said.
Two local Agricultural Bank of China officials were sentenced to 19 and 11  years for "revealing state secrets" as part of the swindle.
The sentences were handed down by the Hengshui intermediate people's court  last month and upheld by the Hebei higher people's court on appeal.
According to Xinhua, Hung Moy and Lee tricked the two bank officials --  Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo -- into issuing 200 irrevocable and transferable  standby letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion dollars.
The letters of credit were to cover three agreements signed by Zhao, Hung  Moy and Lee in April last year on "cooperatively introducing foreign capital  for investment and development projects" worth five billion, 1.6 billion and  3.4 billion dollars.

Taiwan will shortly let foreign insurers join their  US counterparts to operate on its soil as part of an effort to liberalise the  economy, finance ministry officials said Friday.
Authorities here have only permitted US firms to participate in the local  insurance market since 1987, in response to strong demands by Washington.
Under a set of regulations drafted by the ministry, insurance companies  from other countries will be allowed to set up subsidiaries here on a  reciprocal basis, the officials said.
Foreign insurance firms can file applications to the ministry from June 3  to December 2 for operating licenses, they said.
Each applicant is required to hold a minimum paid-up capital of two  billion Taiwanese dollars (74.53 million US) they said, adding that the  Department of Insurance under the ministry will take six months to process  applications.
The move is in line with liberalization required by the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the world trade body which Taiwan is seeking to  join, and will also help Taiwan's aim of becoming a financial hub, they said.
Twenty-two US life and property insurance firms currently compete with 29  Taiwan insurers for the potentially lucrative insurance market here, while 23  other foreign insurers have set up liaison offices on the island.
In May 1992, the authorities revised the insurance law to lift a 30-year  ban on the establishment of new local insurers and allow a foreign enterprise  to hold a maximum 30-percent equity share in a Taiwan insurance company.
Total foreign investment in a local insurance firm must not exceed 49  percent of equity share.
According to statistics compiled by the Taipei Life Insurance Association,  14 domestic insurers enjoyed an all-time high of 19.54 billion Taiwanese  dollars in operating income for 1993, in contrast to a 1.52-billion-dollar  deficit suffered by their 14 US counterparts.
Among the 28 life insurers, Cathay Life Insurance, Shin Kong Life  Insurance, Nan Shan Life Insurance and Kuo Hua Life Insurance cornered up to  95.44 percent of market share last year.
The island's insurance penetration ratio -- the ratio of total premiums  over gross national product -- was 4.39 percent in 1991, compared with 9.76  percent in Britain, 8.89 percent in the United States and 8.7 percent in Japan.
Market analysts said that the ratio was rising, as Taiwan's per capital  income broke the 10,000-US-dollar mark in 1992.

Japan's first woman astronaut, Chiaki Mukai, 42,  will blast off on July 8, in a 13-day mission aboard the US space shuttle  Columbia, the Mainichi daily reported Friday.
The shuttle, which will also have six Americans on board, will carry out  80 experiments in near-zero gravity conditions, under a programme vetted by  the space activities commission of the prime minister's office, it said.
Japan's first man in space was a journalist, Toyohiro Akiyama, who flew  aboard the Soviet Union's Soyuz craft in December 1990.
The Columbia mission takes off from the Kennedy space centre in Florida.

Japan will object to proposals to create a whale  sanctuary in the Antarctic because of its lack of scientific basis,  a  spokesman of the Fisheries Agency said Friday.
Kazuo Shima, head of Japan's delegation to the International Whaling  Commission (IWC) conference in Mexico May 23, said Tokyo would do its "utmost  to block the proposal."
And he warned, "If the proposal for the Antarctic sanctuary is adopted, we  will have to have a basic rethink about our relationship with the IWC."
Shima, who is also deputy director of the Japanese Fisheries Agency, said  other countries were likely to oppose the move, among them Norway, one of the  world's top whaling nations.
A ban on commercial whaling was adopted by the IWC in 1982 but not  enforced until 1986.  Norway and Japan want the ban lifted.
"The IWC's claim makes no sense," said the spokesman. "Statistics released  by the IWC's scientific division showed that some 760,000 Minke whales exist  in the Antarctic Ocean," he said.
The proposal for a whale sanctuary was originally submitted by France.

Israeli officials handed over  five buildings to Palestinian officers in the early hours of Friday as a small  crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the  sites, as women ululated and the crowd continued growing.
The sites were transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed  over from Jordan on Thursday, and to 40 more officers who came in early Friday.
Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to follow later   Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town to the  Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
Four Palestinian flags fluttered on the roof of the central police  station, which until Thursday had been the target of stone-throwing children  and the center of clashes with Israelis soldiers.
Children peered through the metal fence, talking to Palestinian soldiers  within for the first time.
"The Israeli flag had been brought down by the time we came in," said  Ahmed Abu Saadeh, a policeman who crossed over earlier this morning.
"There were no more Israeli soldiers left, we didn't shake hands with any  of them."
The Palestinians also took over the post office, a court house, an  administration building and a nearby synagogue, Abu Saadeh said. The Israelis  are also to formally hand over a main administration compound and historic  ruins later Friday.
"If all goes well, all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by  Friday afternoon," Colonel Herzl, a member of the Israeli-Palestinian liaison  commmittee, whose full name was withheld for security reasons, said Thursday.
The Jericho area is to remain a military closed zone until the handover,  regional military commander Ilan Biran said.
It will "stop Israelis hostile to the peace process creating trouble,  because this town has become a symbol of autonomy in the West Bank," he added.
Jewish settlers had protested the transfer of power, and some members of  the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, staged a sit-in at the synagogue in  protest.
The synagogue lies within the Palestinian autonomy region but is expected  to be controlled in coordination with the Israeli religious affairs authorites.
"I didn't expect them to hand over the sites this quiet way," said  taxi-driver Attia Barham, 40.
"But there have been so many changes in plans that I'm not surprised.
"The Israelis saw how happy we were and didn't want to let us rejoice," he  said, referring to the discreet way the officers were let in to the region.
The transfer took place in the presence of only half a dozen taxi-drivers  on the main square near the police station, and about 50 people who had stayed  up all night trying to track down the officers.
An hour later, more than 100 men, women and children had gathered on the  square.
Israeli soldiers were stationed one kilometer (half a mile) away, at the  junction of a road they will patrol Friday with the Palestinian police. The  Palestinians are also due to take over a military base called Hanan, to be  changed to al Aqsa, the name of one of their units.
The Israeli army is also redeploying in Gaza to protect the 4,000 settlers  who remain there. It pulled out of Rafah town early Thursday, where the first  300 police have already arrived.
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza  and Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday.
"Our forces are ready to come immediately. Moreover we have the feeling  that we are finally in our own country," Yussef said.
Unlike the overcrowded Gaza Strip with its population of around 800,000,  the Jericho police are taking over a quiet oasis of 15,000 people, which is  known as both the oldest and lowest town in the world.

US and Cambodian customs officials are holding  a joint anti-drug seminar here aimed at helping Cambodia prevent the  trafficking of drugs across its borders, a US embassy official said Friday.
The eight-day seminar, which opened Tuesday, is aimed at "helping Cambodia  combat international drug trafficking and increase customs skills across the  board," US embassy spokesman Dave Miller said.
Cambodia's lawlessness has contributed to the relative ease of transit of  high-grade heroin from the Golden Triangle to its southern ports on the Gulf  of Thailand.
Cambodian law does not specifically outlaw drugs, but smuggling  "contraband" -- which is undefined by law, but interpreted to include drugs  and weapons -- carries a jail term of 25 years.

The Philippine government on Friday ordered the  immediate closure of four provincial airports, citing gross safety hazards to  aviation.
The Air Transportation Office said in a memorandum that international  civil aviation rules and a Philippine building code "has been violated and  continuously being violated with impunity and total disregard for the safety  of flight operations" in the Dipolog, Bacolod, Cauayan and San Jose airports.
"This cannot be allowed to continue any further as we are exposing every  day passengers and crew to danger, and potential losses of property," the  memorandum said, adding that local government authorities had failed to act on  the violations.
The closure order takes effect at one p.m. (0500 GMT) Friday and covers  general aviation and non-tactical military operations.
Bacolod, in the central islands, and Dipolog in the south are serviced  daily by the national flag carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL), which also flies  four times weekly to San Jose south of Manila and twice a week in Cauayan in  the north.
PAL spokesmen could not be reached for comment on the order.

Shining Path guerrillas set off bombs outside seven  banks around Lima late Thursday injuring four people and causing widespread  damage, police said.
One of the injured was taken to hospital, the sources said.
The blasts, heard throughout the city, caused heavy damage to some of the  buildings. In the Surquillo suburb, one explosion shattered windows in a  100-meter (yard) radius, police said.
Blackouts spread accross some neighborhoods south of central Lima after  guerrilla commandos damaged power lines.
Witnesses said rebel leaflets hailing the upcoming 14th anniversary of  their movement were strewn around some of the bomb sites.
Police said the attacks were part of the Shining Path's "celebrations"  leading up to their May 17 anniversary.
The Maoist rebel movement, seemingly unshaken by a three-year government  crackdown that netted and jailed its founder and leader Abimael Guzman, has  been blamed for 25,000 deaths in the past 14 years.

Three hundred Palestinian  policemen crossed into the West Bank overnight from Jordan and were heading by  bus for the Gaza Strip, an army spokesman said Friday.
The men from the Palestine Liberation Army will join 300 of their comrades  who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and Wednesday nights through the Rafah  border from Egypt.
"They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and will probably  enter Gaza from the south," the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, in Jericho the Israelis handed over five buildings to 60  Palestinian officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of  residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to follow later   Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town and the Gaza  Strip to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
And three more Palestinian police had been stuck all night at the Rafah  border because of what PLO officials described as "a big problem", but refused  to elaborate.

Japan will send its top trade negotiators to the  United States as early as next week in a bid to break the impasse in stalled  talks, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday.
The announcement followed reports that the United States had softened its  tough stance in the talks, which collapsed in February.
Asked if this was the case, Hata told a news conference: "Rather than  softening, it's better to think that the atmosphere is such that both sides  must do their best."
The negotiators going to Washington were named as Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice  minister for international affairs at the international trade and industry  ministry, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a separate news conference the  government had decided to accelerate moves toward an early resumption of the  talks.
The decision came during his meeting earlier Friday with Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumazai, he said.
But Kakizawa said Washington had requested that Tokyo avoid discussing  details of the negotiations in public for the time being.
"The American side asked us not to make disclosure until the resumption of  the talks," he said.

An inventive Japanese housing cooperative is  undercutting market prices by as much as a fifth, enabling it to sell a tiny  home in the Tokyo suburbs for the (comparatively) rock-bottom price of 465,000  dollars.
The cooperative, West Tokyo Home Center, purchases the land and carries  out the construction itself, thus cutting out layers of intermediaries who  inflate property prices, the Mainichi daily said Friday.
The home, measuring 89 square metres (957 square feet), lies on a tiny  parcel of land of 109 square metres (1,171 square feet) at Higashi-Kurume, a  40-minute train ride from central Tokyo.
Housing prices in Japanese cities are notoriously high, although they have  recently dropped, reflecting the country's economic difficulties, and the fall  has accelerated this year.

An Iranian Jumbo jet with 60 tons of explosives  and raw materials for weapons landed in Zagreb May 4 in violation of a UN arms  embargo, The Washington Post reported Friday.
Two thirds of the shipment went to the Bosnian Moslems and the rest to  Croatia, the daily said quoting Western diplomats and Bosnian Moslem sources  in Sarajevo.
The delivery underscores the fragility of the September 1991 arms embargo  imposed by the UN Security Council on former Yugoslavia, and Iran's commitment  to Bosnia's outgunned Moslems.
News of the shipment came hours ahead of a meeting Friday in Geneva of  European, Russian and American foreign ministers on Bosnia, and the US  Senate's approval Thursday of a measure that would require Washington to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia.
President Bill Clinton, who could veto the measure should it be passed by  the House of Representatives, has called for a multilateral lifting of the  embargo to avoid undermining UN actions around the world.
The Iranian Boeing 747 unloaded 40 containers, marked "Humanitarian Aid,"  of explosives, fusing equipment and other raw materials for the production of  mortars and different types of ammunition, the Post said.
The material intended for the Bosnian Moslems was loaded on a convoy of  government trucks, the sources said.
"This is the first weapons-related convoy from the highest level since the  war began. It is a groundbreaker. We're hoping for more," a Bosnian military  source told the daily.
Western officials said the shipment adds to other foreign weaponry  smuggled into Bosnia, such as Brazilian assault rifles and a Chilean-made  anti-tank gun, from unknown sources.
The stream of weapons has improved the fighting capability of the Bosnian  Moslem forces, some of their officers said. "Tanks are not a problem for us  anymore," one high-ranking officer told the daily.

Two Indian Air Force Ilyushin transport planes  flew home 381 Indian citizens Friday from strife-torn Yemen, the Press Trust  of India (PTI) reported.
The planes landed in Bombay, the news agency said.
The evacuation followed the airlift Thursday of 201 Indians who had been  caught in the civil war in Yemen, where some 7,000 Indians live.

Three hundred Palestinian  policemen crossed into the West Bank from Jordan overnight and headed by bus  for the Gaza Strip under Israeli army escort, a military spokesman said Friday.
The men from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) will join 300 of their  comrades who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and Wednesday nights through the  Rafah border from Egypt.
"They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and will probably  enter Gaza from the south," the spokesman said.
They belong to the PLA's "Badr" brigade stationed in Jordan and were  driving down the Dead Sea, up through the Negev desert and across west to the  Strip.
The men were armed but without munitions, which were held only by one  officer on each of the 10 buses.
Meanwhile, in Jericho the Israelis handed over five buildings to 60  Palestinian officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of  residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to follow later   Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town and the Gaza  Strip to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
And 300 more Palestinian police had been stuck all night at the Rafah  border because of what PLO officials described as "a big problem", but refused  to elaborate.
Palestinian sources said the Israeli authorities objected to certain names  among the 300 and that a major argument ensued.
Israeli security forces have handed over control of all the south of the  Gaza Strip to the fledgling police force, except for the Jewish settlements  which remain under army protection. Security installations were given to the  Palestinians at Khan Yunes in the night, the army spokesman said.
Facilities in Gaza City were scheduled to be handed over on Sunday.
The Palestinian police is due to have 9,000 men, 7,000 of them from PLA  units scattered across the Arab world.

China has named a propaganda expert to head the  country's film, radio and television ministry, an indication that the  communist party wants to strengthen its ideological control, political  analysts said Friday.
Sun Jiazheng, 50, who has made his career with the party in Jiangsu  province, eastern China, replaces Ai Zhisheng, 66, who has been moved to a  minor post with the central committee's propaganda department.
"Naming a relatively young apparatchik, known to be ambitious and tough,  the government is showing its determination to strengthen its media control,"  said a western diplomat.
The government is tightening the screws everywhere because it fears social  unrest might erupt, the diplomat added.
The exceptional praise which Prime Minister Li Peng heaped on Sun in the  People's Daily Friday underlined the importance the party attaches to his  nomination.
Li described Sun Jiazheng as having an excellent "ideological and  political level" as well as great experience.
The governent has taken several steps this year to reduce press,  audiovisual and cultural freedoms in general.
The authorities have decided to limit the number of parabolic antennae  used to capture satellite programmes and also plan to reduce the number of  joint cinema productions with foreign companies.
The government regularly criticises artists who try to produce programmes  independently, particular young film producers.

The United States needs to start behaving like a  superpower by showing commitment to friendly nations and respect for their  laws, a Singapore newspaper said Friday.
The Straits Times, referring to the caning here of American teenager  Michael Fay for vandalising cars, said that there was still "too much rancour"  in America's management of "fallout" from the row triggered by the affair.
The paper said in an editorial that US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  was guilty of "gross indecency" in moving to block Singapore's bid to host the  first meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The paper said that while Kantor's move was clearly linked to the Fay  affair, the trade representative's hijacking of the decision-making  prerogative of WTO members was an indiscretion that should be condemned.
"Member states decide who shall be the host. Singapore may or may not get  the vote, but it should not be because of the Fay case," it added.
The Straits Times said that just as the Olympic movement was debased by  arguments over China's human rights record, Kantor's move threatened to  distort conduct of international relations by dragging the WTO into a  bilateral squabble.
The paper said that the affair raised the spectacle of the world's  strongest nation being manipulated by the 18-year-old's overwrought family,  adding: "It was amusing, now it gets tiresome."
Fay received four lashes of the cane on his bare buttocks last week after  pleading guilty to spray-painting cars, pelting them with egges and keeping  stolen road signs and flags.
The subordinate court sentenced him to six strokes of the cane, a fine and  four months jail but President Ong Teng Cheong dropped two strokes after  repeated appeals by President Bill Clinton to spare the rod.
The Straits Times also accused the US government of waffling over  admitting Singapore's claim that accounts by Fay's father, George Fay, and his  American lawyer, Theodore Simon, on the teenager's condition after the caning  were exaggerated.
Singapore's Prisons Department in a statement last week denied claims by  George Fay and Simon that the lashing left Fay unable to sit during a meeting  with a US embassy official and that blood had run down the teenager's legs  during the beating.
"If it (the United States) does not believe the Prisons Department  account, it should say outright that the Singapore government is lying," the  Straits Times said.
"If the US accepts it as accurate, it owes Singapore an obligation to be  forthright," the paper added.

China jailed two US citizens on Friday in a fraud  case of staggering proportions, emphasizing the campaign to stem the wave of  crime that has swept the country since economic liberalisation.
Francisco Hung Moy and Raymond Lee, both Chinese-Americans, were jailed   for 20 and 14 years respectively after public trials in the northern province  of Hebei, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
They were charged with bilking an Agricultural Bank of China branch in  Hebei of 200 standby letters of credit worth 10 billion dollars last year,  although no money was paid out.
Two officials of the bank -- one of China's largest -- were also jailed  for 19 and 11 years for "revealing state secrets" and for being conned by the  businessmen, Xinhua added.
The latest sentence in China's on-going battle against endemic corruption  was handed down Friday by the Higher People's Court of Hebei Province, which  upheld earlier convictions by two lower courts.
It came three weeks before Clinton must judge whether to renew China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status in the face of persistent concerns  in Washington for human rights.
"The timing is very provocative to the United States," one analyst said.
The case, he said, may call into question the safety in China of overseas  Chinese of any nationality, many of whom have found themselves detained in  remote cities after running afoul with local business partners.
US diplomats in Beijing had no immediate comment, although Xinhua claimed  that their embassy had been informed of the trial date "in accordance with a  Sino-US consular treaty."
Moy, 45, was chairman of United Asia (Group) Corp., and Lee, 44, its  finance manager, but Xinhua did not name the pair's hometown or place of  business.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, to which most US citizens  doing business in China belong, had no record of either men or of their  company on their database.
According to Xinhua, Moy and Lee tricked the two bank officials, Zhao  Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo, into issuing 200 irrevocable and transferable standby  letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion dollars.
Zhao was director of the Hengshui branch of the Agricultural Bank, while  Xu was his deputy.
The letters of credit were to cover three agreements signed by Zhao, Moy  and Lee in April 1993 on "cooperatively introducing foreign capital for  investment and development projects" worth five billion, 1.6 billion and 3.4  billion dollars, it said.
"During discussions, Moy and Lee claimed that their corporation had many  powerful business partners in many countries," Xinhua said.
Later on, when "some foreign companies" questioned the authenticity of the  letters of credit, Lee "cheated Zhao again" into agreeing to a letter  "repeating their lie that the letters... caused no risk to the bank."
The court held that the swindle caused severe social damage, infringed  upon the rights and interests of the Agricultural Bank, and seriously hampered  China's financial and social order, Xinhua said.

More than 300 Palestinian  policemen began crossing into the West Bank from Jordan on Friday as the  Israelis handed over power in Jericho.
The Palestinians are to be in full control of the ancient city by late  Friday if all goes well, ending 27 years of occupation, Israeli and  Palestinian officials said.
The first five buses carrying the ex-soldiers of the Palestine Liberation  Army, who were formerly based in Iraq, crossed the Allenby Bridge at the  border with Jordan and were at the Israeli post on the West Bank side of the  bridge.
Another four buses were expected to follow, said Adel Barahmi, a  Palestinian employee at the border.
Sixty Palestinian officers arrived in Jericho over the last 24 hours and  had begun taking over Israeli installations Friday morning.
The Israelis handed over five buildings, including the central police  station, the post office and administration offices in line with the PLO  autonomy agreement signed in Cairo on May 4.
Twenty of the officers arrived Thursday, and the rest came across in the  early hours of Friday.
Hundreds of Palestians turned out in the streets to celebrate.

Ernesto Zedillo, of the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), came under fire from his two main rivals late  Thursday, in Mexico's first-ever televised debate of presidential candidates.
During 90 minutes, millions of Mexicans watched the three leading  contenders in the August 21 elections: Zedillo, Cuahtemoc Cardenas of the  leftist Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) and Diego Fernandez of the  conservative National Action Party (PAN).
The son of a former president and PRI dropout, Cardenas, 60, promised to  set up a constitutional assembly in 1997 if he is elected and called on  Fernandez to "fight together for democracy."
The possibility of the PRD and PAN joining forces, political analysts  said, would make Zedillo a loser and put the lid on the PRI's 65-year  stranglehold on the government.
Fernandez, a 53-year-old lawyer and member of Congress, did not respond to  Cardenas' proposal but joined him in calling for a "pluralist government" and  for an "end to the party of state (the PRI)."
After years of hearing only the soothing drone of official statements on  television, Mexicans could hardly believe their ears as the opposition  candidates tore into past and present government policy.
Cardenas and Fernandez called for an end to corruption in the police force  and the justice system, to current economic policy, to poverty gnawing at 40  million Mexicans, to the present constitution, to the urbanization of the  country, to unemployment and job insecurity, and to rising prices and violence.
Fernandez showed no mercy for Zedillo.
"You are here because of two tragedies: the March 23 assassination of Luis  Donaldo Colosio (Zedillo's predecessor as PRI candidate) and the 'finger,'"  the PAN candidate said referring to the age-old tradition of PRI presidents to  personally choose their successors.
"The first (tragedy) you had nothing to do with. The second, disqualifies  you from speaking of democracy," Fernandez told the former, little-known  education and programming minister.
Cardenas pounded the PRI by saying that the July 1988 presidential  elections -- that brought President Carlos Salinas to power -- were the most  "fraudulent and tainted" in the country's history, echoing the same criticism  made by the opposition and the international media six years ago.
A year after leaving the PRI in 1987, his attempts at party reform having  failed, Cardenas ran against Salinas on the National Democratic Front ticket  but was soundly defeated by a 51-30 percent margin.
Zedillo, 42, took a calmer approach telling viewers that "the first hurdle  we will have to overcome is extreme poverty," and promising a "real and  thorough reform of the justice system, even starting from scratch."
Admitting that the police and justice system were far from perfect, the  new PRI candidate called on Mexicans to "look to the future, not the past."
Zedillo reproached his rivals for attempting to exploit Colosio's murder  (in Tijuana), and reminded viewers that he rose from a modest background to  twice become government minister because "Mexico is a land of opportunity...in  Mexico effort has its reward."

Police discovered the disembowelled bodies of  four army majors in Kompong Speu province bordering Phnom Penh, a local  newspaper reported Friday.
The bodies of the four, who had been reported missing, were discovered by  police May 6, the Rasmey Kampuchea paper said.
Police said they were continuing their investigation into the brutal  murders.
But a local soldier, who was not named, told the paper that the four might  have been killed because they had failed to come through with jobs they had  promised in exchange for money.
They had also borrowed money and failed to pay it back, the soldier said.

A member of Israel's proxy militia was  killed and two others were wounded Friday in a remote-controlled bomb attack  in Israel's security zone in south Lebanon, the South Lebanon Army (SLA) said.
The bomb was detonated as their patrol drove along a road on the edge of  the zone, the militia said.
SLA gunners retaliated by pounding the Kfarhune village facing the zone,  where Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas are entrenched.
Guerrillas fired a surface-to-air SAM-7 missile Wednesday at an Israeli  helicopter as it circled over Kfarhune, but missed.

Defying protests from Thailand, Australia and five  other countries are considering new military aid for Cambodia following a plea  by King Norodom Sihanouk to save Cambodia "from the yoke" of the Khmer Rouge,  officials said Friday.
Talks have been launched between Australia, France, the United States and  some Asian countries about bolstering Cambodia's ill-disciplined, often unpaid  and poorly equipped military, and a decision on aid could be made by June,  they said.
But Thailand, Cambodia's neighbour, has warned Australia against any  external involvement that could escalate an already bitter conflict, the  officials confirmed.
Thai national security council chief General Charan Kullavanijaya  condemned Australia's interest in providing military help, saying any hardware  would be sold by corrupt Cambodian troops or used in banditry against their  own people, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported Friday.
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Friday in a statement Australia was  giving "serious consideration" to Cambodia's request and would take into  account the view of other countries, including Thailand.
The situation has deteriorated, he said, but added that an upsurge in  activity by the Khmer Rouge before the onset of the rainy season has been a  traditional guerrilla tactic, and Australia does not view the situation as  "alarming."
King Sihanouk, speaking after a series of reversals for the Cambodian  government forces against the ultra-left guerrillas, expressed despair  Thursday for his country's future, and said military aid seemed to be only  solution.
But he has also admitted to widespread problems of indiscipline and  corruption within the army's ranks.
The United States on Wednesday said it was considering providing "lethal  assistance" to Phnom Penh, but stressed the aid could not be on a unilateral  basis.
Foreign affairs official Lyndall McLean told AFP Cambodia had asked half a  dozen countries for assistance but no country had yet committed itself.
"There are discussions going on at the moment as to whether it could be  done as an international package," said McLean, a former Australian charges  d'affaires and deputy director of the UN transitional authority in Phnom Penh.
But Australia was sympathetic to the situation in which the Cambodian  government now found itself, embroiled in a conflict that was preventing it  from carrying out development work.
"We are looking at military assistance, but whether that package is  training, material or whatever has yet to be determined," she said.
She described the Khmer Rouge as more disciplined, better trained and  organised and the Cambodian forces as "a bit of a rag-tag bundle" of three  previously disparate armies.
"Because of the economic difficulties (they are) still not getting fully  paid, and they have nowhere near the level of discipline," McLean added.
"So in looking at ways in which the Royal Cambodian Army could be  strengthened, it is not just armaments. It really does need some top-to-bottom  house cleaning, training and restructuring.
"There would have to be assurances that what was provided, if anything,  was properly utilised, not sold off, that they are going to take care of it  and that the structure of the army is improved to the extent that they would  become more competent and be able to use that equipment more effectively," she  said.
Although Canberra is a major backer of Cambodia -- last month doubling its  aid package to 92 million dollars (66 million US) over four years -- military  aid is minimal and focused at the moment on mine clearance and naval training.
Australia, which played the key role in developing the Paris accords that  brought a measure of democracy and, for a time, relative peace to Cambodia  does not intend to play a similar role in the current Cambodian crisis, McLean  stressed.

An offer by ethnic Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan  guaranteeing a two billion peso (71.43 million dollars) for Philippine  Airlines (PAL) in return for full management control was Friday being examined  by the government, its biggest shareholder.
Tan controls PR Holdings Inc, the consortium which acquired 67 percent of  the troubled airline from the government in 1992, but he is hampered by its  dominance of the PAL board.
Cesar Sarino, one of six government representatives on the 14-member  board, said PR Holdings had guaranteed the airline would turn a two  billion-peso annual profit should Tan be given "full management control."
Tan, who holds five seats on the board, previously asked several foreign  entities, including Hong Kong-based Robert Kuok whom he is believed to have  personally approached, to buy into the government's holdings in PAL to ensure  management of the airline was secured by the private sector.
Spokesmen for PR Holdings and PAL management declined to comment on the  reported offer.
The government holds 46 percent equity in PAL, 33 percent directly and the  rest through its companies which are members of the PR Holdings consortium.
Those companies have have previously expressed reluctance to part with  their holdings.
PAL sources said the airline, which scrapped its unprofitable Rome flight  this month, was in danger of going into the red. Revenue and profit figures  for fiscal 1993 ended March still have to be made public.
Its net profit in the first nine months of its fiscal year were 56.9  million pesos (2.03 million dollars), compared with 1.025 billion pesos (36.6  million dollars) for all of 1992.
PAL attributed the decline to various charges, such as adjustment in  earning figures, expenses on grounded planes and the write-off of unservicable  parts.

Indonesia on Friday said it was "happy" after the  wives of the French and Portuguese presidents decided not to attend a  controversial seminar on East Timor, the former Portuguese colony ruled by  Jakarta.
"We received this news with full relief. We are happy," Indonesian foreign  ministry spokesman Irawan Abidin said.
The organisers of the private May 31-June 2 seminar in Manila had  announced that Danielle Mitterrand, a well-known human rights campaigner and  wife of French President Francois Mitterrand, and Maria Barroso Soares, wife  of President Mario Soares of Portugal would attend.
The meeting, attended by non-governmental organisation, intends to focus  on the state of human rights in East Timor, where activists say tens of  thousands have been killed in Indonesia's 18-year rule.
The presence of Mitterrand and Soares threatened a diplomatic scandal,  with Indonesia on Wednesday voicing anger at the Philippines as the choice of  venue, and the Philippines retorting that it had no power to block the meeting.
State Secretary Murdiono said Friday: "We will not send a protest note,  but we are certainly very disappointed with (the holding of) such a  conference."
Irawan denied that Indonesia -- a fast-developing economy and major  purchaser of arms -- had exerted any pressure in Europe to torpedo the  invitations.
"Those two ladies have their own judgement," he said.
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Friday that he would make a statement on  the issue later Monday after meeting a special envoy from Manila, former  foreign minister Raul Manglapus, who is scheduled to arrive here Sunday.
Irawan said: "if that conference was providing jobs, or investment for  East Timor, we would welcome that. But not when it's trying to put Indonesia  in the dock."

Australia's teddy-bear like marsupial, the koala,  could become extinct because of the frequency of bush fires and housing  developments, the Australian Koala Foundation said Friday.
The foundation, which has been monitoring the effects of the devastating  January bush fires on koala habitats along the New South Wales coast, warned  their numbers had been severely depleted.
Research had found that in one area considered a koala stronghold, the  Tweed Shire, their numbers had fallen from 1,000 animals per 600 hectares  (1,482 acres), to one koala for every five or 10 hectares (24.7 acres).
"The densities of koalas in the wild are much lower than it was previously  suspected," said Steve Phillips, manager of the Koala Foundation's  Brisbane-based environment division.
"We suspect they will become extinct. They can't handle the impacts we  have imposed on the environment whether roads, houses or fires."
Phillips said major bush fires swept through koala habitats every four or  five years, or twice in a koala's generation, and the animal took between 10  and 15 years to recycle.
It was important to increase awareness of the endangered species, as  Australians would never be able to conquer bush fires, which were a natural  part of the environment, he said.
"Too many people don't think of the consequences when they throw a  cigarette out the window," he said.

Thousands of refugees from Rwanda's ethnic  slaughter have fled to northern Burundi and put a great strain on the  country's limited relief food stocks, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) stated  Friday.
In a statement faxed to AFP here on Friday from the Burundian capital,  Bujumbura, WFP officials said the greatest influx was in the northeastern  province of Muyinga, where the refugee population rose from 2,000 to 20,000 in  less than a week.
Many of the refugees in Muyinga have arrived in a weakened state, some  with wounds and most with few or no provisions, a WFP official based in Ngozi  said Thursday, according to the statement.
Refugees from Rwanda, where an estimated 200,000 people have died in civil  war and bloodletting between the minority Tutsi and majority Hutu tribes,  started crossing into Burundi a month ago, but the rate of arrivals suddenly  rose last week as the refugee influx to Tanzania slowed.
A total of 63,000 Rwandan refugees are now located in Burundi's north and  northeastern provinces of Kayanza (5,700), Kirundo (13,500), Ngozi (17,000)  and Muyinga (26,500), the statement said.
To meet the growing needs of 900,000 people currently affected in Burundi,  WFP has had to borrow food from relief stocks already in place for internally  displaced people and Burundian returnees. Serious logistical constraints  continue to make delivery of adequate food rations to Burundi very difficult,  the statement added.
Before the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and  Cyprien Ntaryamira, were both killed in a suspected rocket attack on their  plane the Rwandan capital Kigali on April 6, triggering the Hutu-Tutsi war in  Rwanda, WFP was already feeding 680,000 Burundians affected by ethnic violence  resulting from the October 21 failed military coup which killed Burundi's  first elected president from the Hutu majority, Melchior Ndadaye.
But after April 6, an additional 145,000 Burundians returned from refugee  camps in Rwanda, and with 63,000 new arrivals from Rwanda, the WFP has to  provide them with relief until they can sustain themselves and/or return  safely to their homes, the statement added.

The Palestinian police were  in control of the southern Gaza Strip on Friday as about 300 more  reinforcements arrived and the Israelis pulled out of their last bastion.
"Everything south of the river is in the hands of the Palestinian police,"  a senior Israeli military official said.
The river, known as Wadi Gaza, cuts across the Strip south of the Jewish  settlement of Netzarim.
Israeli forces however remain in charge of security of the 4,000 settlers,  most of whom live in the south of Gaza.
Israeli security forces handed over security installations at Khan Yunes  in the night, the army spokesman said.
It was the last town in the south to be evacuated following Deir El Balah,  Bureij, Nusseirat and Rafah.
Before dawn the army handed over the military administration, border  police and military command buildings in Khan Yunes to 30 policemen who had  just entered the Strip from Egypt.
The army said there was a small ceremony and the local commander, whose  name was not revealed, wished the Palestinians "every success".
Plans of building and telephones were handed over in the transfer.
Facilities in Gaza City were scheduled to be handed over on Sunday, PLO  officials said, and the transfer of authority to be completed by Wednesday.
About 300 Palestinian policemen entered the Strip on Friday and were  deployed in Rafah after travelling from Jordan overnight, PLO officials said.
The men from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) join 330 of their  comrades who arrived in three groups on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights  through the Rafah border from Egypt.
The newcomers belong to the PLA's "Badr" brigade who were stationed in  Jordan. They crossed the Jordan River and drove through the West Bank aboard  six buses and three jeeps under Israeli army escort.
Their arrival in Rafah, a stronghold of Palestinian resistance, ignited  street celebrations and firing in the air in a repeat of scenes witnessed all  over the strip as the police have taken over.
Meanwhile, in Jericho the Israelis handed over five buildings to 60  Palestinian officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of  residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were crossing the River  Jordan during the day.
The Israelis were set to relinquish total control of the West Bank town by  sunset.
However more than 200 Palestinian police had been stuck all night at the  Rafah border because of what PLO officials described as "a big problem", but  refused to elaborate.
Palestinian sources said the Israeli authorities objected to certain names  and that a major argument ensued. Only 30 Palestinians had been allowed  through to take over Khan Yunes.
Israel's military commander for Gaza, General Doron Almog, told state  radio the handover was proceeding according to plan.
"We are continuing with the pprogramme drawn up in coordination with the  Palestinian generals.
"We have some problems and they have some problems but we get over the  problems."
"We don't want there to a vacuum on the ground. We want to hand over the  buildings in an orderly fashion.
"There is a timetable but anywhere Israelis soldiers remain there can be  difficulties because people can get in the buildings and smash everything. We  don't want that to happen."
"At the start they will have difficulties. But the police are the same  people are those who live in Gaza. I think that after a period of instability,  stabilty will be established.
"The fact that I am sitting down with Palestinian generals, that I am  talking with them, sorting out problems around a table and not with guns is  very moving."
"The fact that we have a coordination office which is working now ...  represents everyone's hope that perhaps in the future we will live a better,  shared life, perhaps without almost any violence."
The Palestinian police is due to have 9,000 men, 7,000 of them from PLA  units scattered across the Arab world, in line with the autonomy deal signed  on May 4.

Boris Yeltsin's communist and nationalist opponents  have agreed to devise a joint action program against the Russian president  when they hold a national meeting at the end of May, press reports quoting  communist party leader Gennady Ziuganov said Thursday.
Yeltsin's arch-rival, former vice president Alexander Rutskoi who was a  leader in the bloody October 1993 hardliners' revolt against Yeltsin but was  freed from prison in February, also called for the opposition to unite, saying  "strength lies only in unity," according to the reports.
The two spoke at a public meeting Thursday night involving a handful of  other movements linked since last February in a coalition called Understanding  for Russia.
Ziuganov and Rutskoi, who last week called for the "overthrow" of the  Yeltsin government, repeated their aim to take over power in Russia by the  50th anniversary next year of the end of World War II in Europe, which is  celebrated on May 9 in Russia.
Rutskoi said the next Victory in Europe day will be "celebrated without  the regime now in power."
Rutskoi told the meeting he favored a takeover of power "in stages." He  said he would wait until the term of the present legislature, to end in  December 1995, before preparing himself for the presidential election.  Yeltsin's current term runs out in June 1996.
Rutskoi also criticized the absence of any joint ceremonies by Russians  and its World War II Western allies to mark the departure of their troops from  Germany.
He said this was the "price of the dwarfish foreign policy led by Boris  Yeltsin and Andrei Kozyrev," his foreign minister.

Britain's three main political parties suspended  their campaigning for the upcoming European elections on Friday as a mark of  respect for the Labour opposition leader John Smith, who died on Thursday.
Campaigning will not resume until after the funeral, for which the family  has not yet announced a date.
The Labour Party announced that it was suspending its campaign on Thursday  afternoon, and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats followed suit during  the night.
Politicians from all parties on Thursday, led by Prime Minister John  Major, paid emotional tributes to the Labour leader in the House of Commons,  which adjourned proceedings after the news.
Smith, who was 55, died of a massive heart attack.
The press on Friday was united in mourning his sudden death as the loss of  a future prime minister.
The Independent carried a front page picture with the headline "The man  who would have led Britain," while the Times hailed him as a leader "who was  on course to become the first Labour prime minister since 1979.

Japan will send its top trade negotiators to the  United States as early as next week in a bid to break the impasse in stalled  trade talks, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday.
The announcement followed growing signs here that the United States had  eased its tough stance in the talks, which collapsed in February.
Asked if this was the case, Hata told a news conference: "Rather than  softening, it's better to think that the atmosphere is such that both sides  must do their best."
The negotiators going to Washington are Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister  for international affairs at the international trade and industry ministry,  and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a separate news conference that the  government had decided to accelerate moves toward an early resumption of the  talks. The decision came during his meeting earlier Friday with Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, he said.
But Kakizawa, who held talks here Thursday with US ambassador Walter  Mondale after telephoning Secretary of State Warren Christopher, said that  Washington had asked Tokyo to avoid discussing details of the negotiations in  public.
"The American side asked us not to make disclosures until the resumption  of the talks," he said.
The two sides made similar promises last year, vowing not to publicise  their respective proposals in Japanese business sectors targetted for action  in the wide-ranging talks aimed at reducing the country's huge trade surplus.
But the promises soon proved to be hollow as the two sides started to  clash over the wording of an agreement reached in July between President Bill  Clinton and Kiichi Miyazawa, who was prime minister at the time.
The agreement called for "objective criteria" to monitor progress in  implementing measures in priority sectors, which fall into the three broad  categories of automotive trade, finance and Japanese government procurement.
After the talks collapsed during former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  visit to Washington in February, the United States invoked the threat of trade  sanctions, including the Super 301 provision of its omnibus trade law.
But Japanese reports say Washington is now softening its approach given  the fragile nature of Hata's new cabinet -- Japan's first minority government  in 39 years -- and the negative impact of trade friction on currency markets.
Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to Clinton on economic policy, was quoted  as saying Thursday that Washington would not resort to retaliatory trade  measures against Japan if some progress were achieved in the talks.
"We will not impose sanctions if there is progress in Japan's actions," he  said in an exclusive interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
"With only two months remaining until the (Group of Seven) summit in  Naples in July, I don't think we can settle everything," he said, referring to  macroeconomic measures and the three priority sectors.
But "we can't say that settling the government procurement issue, which is  closest to agreement, would be enough. We still need efforts to get close to  agreement in all priority areas and macroeconomic measures."
Cutter said Washington was still "waiting for an answer from Japan" to  three conditions for resuming the talks -- compromises in macroeconomic  policies, the purpose of the talks and objective criteria.
Clinton administration officials "understand the difficulty" Hata faces in  reforming the Japanese tax system although "it is obvious that tax reduction  is the best way to reduce Japan's current surplus," he said.
As for the other conditions, Cutter said Washington wants to clarify that  the aim of the talks was "to increase imports and market access in each  sector".
He also insisted that the United States was not pushing for numerical  targets as objective criteria, the newspaper said.

Aid workers have found the bodies of 88 people  massacred in southern Rwanda, a UN spokesman in Kigali said Friday as a battle  for the capital between rebels and government forces raged on.
Abdul Kabia, spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (MINUAR),  said relief workers found the corpses on Friday in the Butare region, but  could not say who carried out the slaughter.
"We thought that massacres in the Butare region had stoppped, but it seems  they are continuing," Kabia said, reached in the Rwandan capital by telephone  from Nairobi.
Shellfire and shooting of every kind could be heard in Kigali on Friday  morning, apparently coming mainly from rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front positions  near the Meridien hotel, AFP's correspondent in the capital meanwhile reported.
The central African highland nation plunged back into civil war between  the RPF, drawn mainly from the Tutsi minority, and the Hutu majority, after  Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspected rocket attack on  his plane on April 6.
Aid agencies estimate that some 200,000 people have been slain in  wholesale ethnic bloodshed during the weeks that followed, amid a massive  humanitarian tragedy.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked the UN Security  Council substantially to reboost UNAMIR, which was originally sent to help  implement a peace signed in August last year but cut back from 2,500 to just  400 men after the renewed violence broke out.

The Spanish central bank cut its main lending rate  a quarter point to 7.50 percent Friday.
The move, which follows a similar cut in the rate on April 22, had been  expected after the Bundesbank cut a half-point from its discount and Lombard  rates on Wednesday.
Analysts expected the Spanish bank to further cut the rate, already at its  lowest level since the 1970s, to 7.0 percent by the end of the year.
Thursday the bank announced that Spain's gross domestic product rose 0.5  percent during the first quarter of the year, ending 15 months of recession.
Economists said this year's growth was due largely to exports and that  domestic demand remained sluggish.

report
BOSTON, Massachusetts, May 13 (AFP) - US war games that began in the  Caribbean and ended in North Carolina and Puerto Rico this week simulated an  invasion of Haiti, The Boston Globe said Friday.
Code-named Agile Provider, the military exercises involved 44,000 troops,  amphibious vessels, fighter jets and a submarine, unnamed military sources  told the daily.
They were planned with Haiti in mind, the sources said.
President Bill Clinton warned last week that he did not rule out a  military intervention to restore democracy in Haiti, and the UN Security  Council adopted his proposal to slap a full economic embargo on the former  French colony.
Although a White House source told the daily the military option was still  in the air, military sources said the exercises were intended to put the  option through a trial run to smooth out coordination problems.
And they could also be a sabre-rattling effort by the Clinton  administration to goad Haiti's military leaders into reinstating President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom they overthrew in September 1991, the military  sources added.
The swearing in of an interim president by the Haitian Senate Wednesday,  however, appears to confirm the military's determination to resist all  pressures.
Organized by the Atlantic Command, based in Norfolk, Virginia, Agile  Provider included the Marines and Army Special Forces, some of whom landed by  submarine. Marine fighter jets flew more than 200 practice sorties during the  exercises, the sources said.
A spokesman for the command said the exercises had as a target a  fictitious country run by an "unfriendly leader" who had suddenly seized power.
The US military option for Haiti has received mixed reviews abroad.  Visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that his government  would not participate in such a venture. The French diplomat, however,  reiterated his condemnation of the military regime in Port-au-Prince and the  naming of interim president Emile Jonassaint, whom Juppe described as a  "puppet with no legitimacy."
He said France was working to enforce the latest Security Council  resolution calling for stiffer sanctions if the military refused to leave  power and restore democracy by May 21.

World Cup longshots and hosts the United States are  favorites at least in the Philippines, where an autographed football from the  team fetched the top price of 76,000 pesos (about 2,714 dollars) at a Miss  Universe charity auction here.
The ball, brought in by Miss United States, Frances Louise Parker, raised  the highest price in a May 10 auction that included an antique Taiwan teapot,  century-old prints from Britain, and ancient silver and brass Egyptian plates,  organizers said.
Contestants from 77 nations that are taking part in the May 21 pageant in  Manila donated the presents to raise funds for local charities.

Seven people died in three and a half weeks  of political tension between rival groups at the Western Areas gold mine west  of here, National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) spokesman Jerry Majatladi said  Friday.
Majatladi said "politically motivated" fighting between supporters of the  Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress  (ANC) started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first non-racial  election.
He said one person was killed on April 17, two others died in fighting  during the April 26-29 poll and four were killed Wednesday.
Nelson Mandela's ANC won the election, while the IFP came in third after  the National Party; members of the three parties make up the government of  national unity that was announced on Wednesday.

Karl Wendlinger's condition was unchanged  here on Friday morning, the Austrian Formula One driver remaining in a deep  coma after his crash in Monaco on Thursday, hospital officials said.
Wendlinger was badly injured when he crashed during a practice session for  the Monaco Grand Prix. He appeared to brake late coming out of the tunnel, the  fastest point on the street circuit.
His parents arrived here overnight by car, and went immediately to their  son's bedside.
A medical bulletin on the Austrian was due to be issued later in the day.
The accident came two weeks after Brazil's triple world champion Ayrton  Senna and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger were killed at the San Marino Grand  Prix.

Ireland's rugby union side see their  eight-match Australian tour as a major stepping stone to next year's World Cup  in South Africa, skipper Michael Bradley said here Friday.
"The squad of 30, including 12 uncapped players, will develop and learn  during their three weeks here," the 31-year old scrum-half from Cork said  after players arrived here ahead of Ireland's first visit to Australia in 15  years.
The programme begins Wednesday with a night match against Western  Australia at one of the world's best known cricket grounds, the WACA (Western  Australian Cricket Association) Ground.
Bradley, who made his international debut against Australia a decade ago,  conceded that the squad's relative inexperience would make it a tough tour.  Especially the two Tests in Brisbane and Sydney against reigning world  champions Australia.
"There are a lot of players the Australian public have not seen, and these  guys are looking forward to expressing themselves on the pitch," he said.
"This side are willing to learn and they learn fast," he said. "It depends  on how games go, but I believe that by the end of the tour we will be a much  better side. It's all part of our World Cup preparations."
The Irish are in a buoyant frame of mind after beating England and drawing  with Scotland in the recent Five Nations championship.
Coach Gerry Murphy said extensive changes to the team meant that only four  players from the side which almost defeated Australia in a 1991 World Cup  quarter-final, now remained. They are full-back Jim Staples, wingman Simon  Geoghehan, flanker Brian Robinson and lock Neil Francis.
It is the first time Ireland have toured Australia since 1979 when they  won the Test series 2-0.
Western Australia, traditional easybeats of the Australian circuit, were  thrashed 39-10 by Natal three weeks ago.
But an optimistic coach Tom Browne said Friday:"We hope this time we may  be able to reverse the usual result."

A man was killed Friday and a woman and two  children were wounded when a bomb exploded in their car in the Northern  Ireland town of Lurgan, police said.
Police could not confirm the identities of the four or say if they  belonged to the same family, although informed sources said the man was a  member of the British security forces.
The bomb went off as the four were getting into the car Friday morning in  Lurgan, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Belfast.
One of the children suffered multiple fractures, police said, but the  condition of the other two injured persons was not immediately known.
Late Thursday, a 23-year-old Catholic man was shot and killed by suspected  Protestant militants in north Belfast and Sunday an elderly Catholic man was  murdered in his home in the western town of Dungannon by members of the  Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force.

The dollar closed higher at 104.58 yen on the Tokyo  foreign exchange market Friday, up 0.48 yen from the previous day's finish of  104.10 yen.
Dealers attributed the dollar's advance chiefly to dollar buying by the  Bank of Japan, the central bank, on the foreign exchange market. The size of  the market intervention was not immediately clear.
Investors bought dollars on press reports that Japanese officials were to  visit Washington to pave the way for resuming framework trade talks with the  United States, dealers said.
The closing rate here Friday was higher than 104.22 yen quoted in New York  in late trading overnight.
After opening at 104.15 yen, the greenback moved between 104.07 yen and  104.73 yen in Tokyo Friday.
Spot turnover increased from the previous day's 5.057 billion dollars to  7.248 billion dollars.
The mark closed at 1.6705 to the dollar here Friday, against 1.6667 the  previous day.

Palestinians raised their flag  over Jericho on Friday as 27 years of Israeli occupation came to an end and  Palestine Liberation Army soldiers poured in to police the autonomous enclave.
The Israelis handed over a series of buildings and a military base to 60  Palestinian officers in pre-dawn darkness on Friday to the cheers of a small  crowd who stayed up all night.
The Israeli flag was lowered and the red, green, white and black  Palestinian emblem run up at the sites. Women ululated with joy and the crowd  swelled as the news spread through the ancient oasis on the edge of the Dead  Sea.
Four Palestinian flags fluttered on the roof of the central police  station, which until Thursday had been the target of stone-throwing children  and the center of clashes with Israelis soldiers.
Now children peered through the metal fence, talking to Palestinian  soldiers within for the first time.
"The Israeli flag had been brought down by the time we came in," said  Ahmed Abu Saadeh, a policeman who crossed over earlier in the morning.
"There were no more Israeli soldiers left, we didn't shake hands with any  of them."
The Palestinians also took over the post office, a court house, a military  administration building and a nearby synagogue.
The Israelis later handed over the main administration compound in an  official ceremony.
"If all goes well, all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by  Friday afternoon," said Colonel Herzl, a member of the commmittee whose full  name was withheld for security reasons.
Israeli soldiers were stationed a kilometer (half a mile) away, at the  junction of a road they will patrol Friday with the Palestinian police.
At the same time, 386 policemen began crossing into Jericho from Jordan  following 20 officers arrived Thursday, and 40 others in the early hours of  Friday.
The first buses carrying the Palestine Liberation Army units, who were  formerly based in Iraq, crossed the Allenby Bridge at the border with Jordan  in the morning.
They were being checked at the Israeli post on the West Bank side of the  bridge.  Another four buses were expected to follow, said Adel Barahmi, a  Palestinian employee at the border.
The Palestinian police force is due to have 9,000 men, 7,000 of them from  PLA units scattered across the Arab world, in line with the autonomy deal  signed on May 4. The PLA is the Palestine Liberation Organisation's regular  army.
Israeli Colonel A, told state radio: "As soon as we have the green light  it will only take us a few hours to pull out. We will withdraw before sunset  if all goes well."
The radio said Israeli citizens would no longer be allowed to enter  Jericho carrying arms.
The Palestinian police took control of the southern Gaza Strip on Friday  as about 300 more reinforcements arrived and the Israelis pulled out of their  last bastion.
"Everything south of the river is in the hands of the Palestinian police,"  a senior Israeli military official said.
The river, known as Wadi Gaza, cuts across the Strip south of the Jewish  settlement of Netzarim. Under the autonomy deal Israeli forces however remain  in charge of security for the 4,000 settlers, most of whom live in the south  of Gaza.
Security installations at the Gaza town of Khan Yunes were handed over in  the night, the army said. It was the last town in the south to be evacuated  following Deir El Balah, Bureij, Nusseirat and Rafah.
Before dawn the army handed over the military administration, border  police and military command buildings in Khan Yunes to 30 policemen who had  just entered the Strip from Egypt.
Facilities in Gaza City were to be handed over on Sunday, PLO officials  said, and transfer of authority on the Strip completed by Wednesday.
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said: "We have the feeling that we  are finally in our own country."
Unlike the overcrowded Gaza Strip with a population of nearly 800,000, the  Jericho police are taking over a quiet oasis of 15,000 people, known as the  world's oldest and lowest town at 250 metres (825 feet) below sea level.

Palestinians broke into  the Khan Yunes post office and stole everything they could carry just hours  after the Israelis handed over the town to the Palestinian police, witnesses  said.
Dozens of youths smashed down the doors and made off with telephones, fax  machines, desks and chairs.
It was not immediately known if money was taken.
The dawn raid came after Israeli security forces handed over the army,  administration and police buildings to 30 Palestinian police officers and  pulled out of the town.
All post offices in the occupied territories, which have been run by the  Israeli authorities, are due to be transferred to the Palestinians under  autonomy.
PLO officials said some 300 other policemen who are due to be stationed in  Khan Yunes have been held up by the Israelis since Thursday at the border  crossing from Egypt.
More than 600 Palestinian police have entered Gaza this week and been  given charge of the south of the strip, but they are not yet operational.

A chicken in western Iran has been laying eggs at  record speed, on average one egg almost every hour, its proud owner said  Friday.
Jalil Khorshidi from Kermanshah told IRNA news agency that the chicken, of  Chinese stock, produced 42 eggs in a 52-hour period, backed by a diet of rice,  wheat and vegetables. But it also eats twice as much as other hens.

UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a bid  to deflect mounting criticism UN operations, said Friday that UN member states  were to blame for any confusion in the world body's action in international  crises such as ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
"The UN is neutral and and carries out the decisions adopted by the 15  states (on the Security Council), which include the five superpowers," he said  in an interview on French radio.
The UN chief was in the French capital to discuss the Bosnian crisis ahead  of an international ministerial conference on the matter Friday in Geneva.
Paris earlier this week threatened to pull its forces out of Bosnia --  where they form the largest UN peacekeeping contingent -- if progress towards  a negotiated settlement cannot be obtained.
The French warning came ahead of the meeting Friday in Geneva by foreign  ministers from the United States, Russia and five European Union states  including France and Britain to try to restart the Bosnian peace process.
Boutros-Ghali said the UN could only be "accused of subjectivity in the  sense that it executes" Security Council decisions.
But he conceded that member states might get "tired" about military and  financial demands if UN peace operations carry on endlessly.
When asked about the French threat of a force pull-out in Bosnia,  Boutros-Ghali said it was up to the Security Council -- of which France is a  permanent member -- to find replacements.
He noted the example of Somalia, where after the departure of US, German,  Belgian and French forces, the UN operation was handled essentially by African  and Asian troops.
"I have no way to prevent a member state from withdrawing its forces" from  a UN military operation," he said.
He also said he regretted huge outstanding financial commitments to the UN  by member states, such as the United States which he said owes more than a  billion dollars.
It was the United Nations' duty "to help member states either find  peaceful solutions to conflicts, or to serve as an alibi for states that need  the United Nations to excuse their lack of action."
He stressed the United Nations had been successful in recent years in El  Salvador, Cambodia and South Africa.
Even in Yugoslavia, he said, the United Nations could claim some successes,  such as aid supplied for some two million refugees and displaced people,  heading off the spread of trouble to Macedonia with a UN deployment and, up to  now, having kept the war inside ex-Yugoslav borders.

They are prisoners in their own capital, paralysed  by fear and ravaged by hunger, sheltering from the gunfire in hotels and  churches and the Kigali sports stadium.
Some 20,000 Rwandans have fled their homes for what they hope are safer  surroundings in the city. There are 3,000 in the Aahoro stadium, more than  6,000 crammed into the King Faisal hospital, several hundred in the Meridien  hotel. They are in the sector held by rebels of the Patriotic Front (RPF),  which draws support mostly from Rwanda's Tutsi minority.
Across town where troops of the government dominated by the Hutu majority  hold sway, 5,000 displaced persons have found a refuge in the Holy Family  church and the adjoining school. There are 550 more in the Thousand Hills  hotel.
But shells hit the Holy Family compound last month, killing 15 people and  leaving more than l00 wounded. There were similar attacks on the stadium and  the hospital, leaving dozens of dead. Everybody else blames the warring  forces, but they deny targeting the refugees. "It was an accident, mortars are  inaccurate weapons," they say.
Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka shows the hole in the church roof.
Hundreds of people are lying in the nave, right up to the altar. In a big  side chapel, Red Cross workers tend the wounded.
Many of the refugees in the hotel are educated people branded as  "intellectuals", along with traders, people under threat because of their  political allegiances or tribal affiliation. They said they had received word  they would be massacred before the week was out.
They sent an SOS to the world community, asking it to put pressure on the  authorities here to let them leave. The United Nations assembled a convoy l0  days ago to take 60 of them to the airport, but soldiers and militiamen turned  them back, wounding several people in the process.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala-Lasso met the  belligerents on Wednesday and Thursday and got promises that something would  be done to let the "hostages" be evacuated. Some want to move to neighbouring  countries, others want to go farther afield, while some simply want to change  their prefectures, coded language meaning they want to go to an administrative  district held by their own tribesmen.
Not all the Tutsi want to go to RPF zones, however, for fear of being  forcibly conscripted to rebel ranks. A refugee at the brand new King Faisal  hospital said the rebel movement executed people who slipped out without  permission. "We can no longer go looking for firewood, food or water," he said.
Prudence spoke in a low voice, fearful of spies overhearing her.
Her husband was an adviser to the murdered prime minister Agathe  Uwilingiyimana, and she does not know if he is still alive.
The ordinary townspeople still in their own homes rush out when the  shooting dies down to fill their cans with water or buy a bag of beans. But  most of the fugitives have not ventured out from their shelters in more than a  month, sure that only death awaits them on the streets.

Benetton picked up their second Formula One team on  Friday, when manager Flavio Briatore took control of French strugglers Ligier.
Briatore, backed by the Italian clothing giant, had been angling for  months to get hold of the team's Renault V-10 engine, which has powered  Williams to two consecutive driver and constructor world titles.
Ligier's entrepreneur owner Cyril de Rouvre, who had bought the team from  Guy Ligier in late 1992, was forced to sell after becoming the subject of a  fraud investigation last December.
A statement, issued by Ligier's sponsors here for the Monaco Grand Prix,  said that of several offers received: "Flavio Briatore's plan seemed the best  solution, one will enable Ligier to make up lost ground technologically, get  back to a competitive level and thereby ensure its future.
"Benetton-Ford's results in the 1994 world championship, its technical  reputation, notably in the area of aerodynamics and suspension, were a  deciding factor in the choice."
Benetton Ford driver Michael Schumacher has won all three Grands Prix this  season.
Briatore, whose Benetton-Ford team is based in Britain, is expected to  outline his plans for Ligier on Saturday evening.

The Principality authorities said on Friday that Prince Rainier had no  plans yet to cancel Sunday's race.
"There is no question of that at the moment," a spokesman said, adding  that such a decision would come from the Automobile Club de Monaco and race  organisers.
The comment follows speculation that if Wendlinger died, the prince would  have the race cancelled.
Officials here were meanwhile awaiting the outcome of a drivers' meeting  which started earlier in the morning.

India has thrown open basic telephone services  to  foreign and domestic private investors in a liberalised telecommunications  investment policy unveiled in parliament Friday.
The policy is aimed at ushering in the eight-billion-dollar investment the  government estimates is needed to provide a "telephone on demand" to its  citizens by 1997.
Individuals have had to wait five years for a connection.
Communications Minister Sukh Ram said it also was aimed at introducing all  "value-added telecom services available abroad" to raise the standard of  Indian telecommunications to world class.
The long-awaited policy, which has a theme of "telecommunications for  all," was announced on the eve of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's  departure for a visit to the United States.
Major US telecom multinationals such as US West Inc. and Motorola Inc.  have been waiting to enter the huge Indian market, where basic telephone  services have until now been a government monopoly.

A UN military observer killed at the edge of the  Sarajevo exclusion zone was a Malaysian, UN forces spokesman Eric Chaperon  said Friday, adding that the shell which hit his vehicle was "not an accident."
Another UN observer injured in the same incident Thursday was an Egyptian  but his life was not in danger, Major Chaperon said.
He identified the dead observer as Major Ariffin Zakaria. He said his body  was to be flown to Kuala Lumpur Friday and a brief military ceremony would be  held in his honor at Sarajevo airport.
He said the Egyptian was Lieutenant Colonel Mohamed Kamal El Din, who  suffered shrapnel wounds to his legs and was evacuated by helicopter to a  Canadian medical unit in Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo.
The UN military spokesman said a single shell was fired on their vehicle  after it got stuck in mud at Cermenica, 15 kilometers (eight miles) northeast  of Visoko.
"It is not an accident of firing," he stressed.
But he refused to say whether the shell had been fired by Bosnian Serb  forces who have a position only a kilometer (less than a mile) from where the  observers' truck got bogged down.
The two UN soldiers had called for assistance.
The spokesman said a Bosnian army soldier was also wounded when he and a  colleague on board a tractor came under fire as they were trying to tow away  the UN vehicle.
He said the Bosnian soldier had been hit in the back, but was out of  danger.

Members of the Israeli parliament opened two days  of informal talks with PLO officials in the Austrian capital on Friday.
The agenda covers autonomy in Palestinian regions, the future status of  Jerusalem, refugees, Jewish settlements in occupied territories, and borders,  a spokesman for the organisers said.
The discussions are being held at the Bruno Kreisky Forum, a political and  scientific institution named after the Austrian chancellor who promoted  recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
The Israeli team includes Eli Dayan, head of the parliamentary group of  the ruling Labour Party, accompanied by Yossi Katz and Avigdor Kahalani.
The PLO side includes Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat,  Assan Abdel Rahrman, PLO representative in Washington, and Ibrahim Karain,  from the PLO information office in Jerusalem.

GATT chief Peter Sutherland all but ruled out  Friday the possibility of China's rejoining the world trade body by the year's  end, labelling the schedule put forward by Beijing "extremely demanding."
While "encouraged" by three days of talks with senior foreign trade  officials here, Sutherland made it clear that China was some way from  realising its aim to be in at the inception of the World Trade Organisation  (WTO), which replaces the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on  January 1.
"It is still going to be extremely difficult, with the best will in the  world, to achieve the timeframe we have spoken of," Sutherland told a press  conference.
"The time schedule is extremely demanding."
The GATT secretary-general also stressed there was "no practical  difference" in whether China joined the international trading regime on  "January 1, April 1 or June 1."
"Really what we should be talking about is the likelihood of a  satisfactory outcome at the end of the day. The end of the day being not too  distant," he said.
China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the communists  came to power in 1949, has repeatedly made it clear that it attaches great  political significance to readmission before the new year.
Sutherland said he had seen signs of "genuine will and flexibility" from  the Chinese side during his visit, but added that doubts remained over the  transparency of China's foreign trade regime, especially policies governing  import quotas, licences and standards.
"I do not wish to minimise the amount of additional discussion that has to  be undertaken," he said.

Israel officially  handed over the town of Jericho to the Palestinian police on Friday with a  handshake between two generals.
Journalists watched as Israel's central region military commander General  Ilan Biram grasped the hand of Palestine Liberation Army General Hajj Ismail  to mark the transfer of power.

China has released five Christians from  re-education camps, the official news agency Xinhua reported Friday.
They were identified as Chen Zhuman, Yan Peizhi, Xu Zhihe, Cui Tai and  Zhang Li.
The five had been sentenced to re-education in Fujian province,  southeastern China, Shandong, in the east and Hebei in the north for having  "disturbed public order and endangered public security by their religious  activities," the agency said.

Israel officially  handed over the autonomous Jericho enclave to the Palestinian police on Friday  with a handshake between two generals.
Journalists watched as Israel's central region military commander General  Ilan Biran (eds. correct) grasped the hand of Palestine Liberation Army  General Hajj Ismail to mark the transfer of power.
The ceremony took place by the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan with the  West Bank after 386 Palestinian police crossed the River Jordan.
"I wish you good luck," Biran said.
"Thank you," Ismail replied. "I hope we will be successful together on the  road to peace."
Palestinian youths shouted "Allah u Akbar" (God is great) and pro-PLO  slogans.
"There are now 462 Palestinian policemen in Jericho," Ismail said.
A first group of officers arrived Thursday followed by about 40 more  overnight. Before dawn they took over a series of official buildings ranging  from the police station to the post office .

Palestinians woke up Friday to  find their own policemen in charge of this sleepy oasis after the Israelis  pulled out of the first autonomous enclave.
"We went to bed expecting another day of waiting," said Khaled Abed after  repeated delays in the handover of power since autonomy was officially  launched on May 4 when Israel and the PLO signed an agreement in Cairo.
"And then what a surprise this morning when we saw the police station we  had learned to hate so much occupied by ... Palestinians," the 28-year-old  said.
Israel officially handed over the town on Friday with a handshake between  its central region military commander, General Ilan Biran, and Palestine  Liberation Army (PLA) General Hajj Ismail.
Earlier, the Israelis discreetly transferred key installations to  Palestinian police officers under cover of darkness.
Forty Palestinian police officers slipped into Jericho from Jordan in the  middle of the night to join 20 of their colleagues who arrived Thursday, but  kept out of the public eye.
Before dawn they were handed over the keys to the police station watched  only by half-a-dozen taxi drivers.
But the news spread like wild fire as a series of buildings from the post  office to a Jewish synagogue were handed over.
Whole families rushed out to the main square to see for themselves.
The front of the police station was hardly recognizable. Green, red, white  and black Palestinian flags had submerged the whole facade and fluttered from  the roof.
Where youths once darted past lobbing rocks at the enemy behind the high  wire fences, hundreds of Palestinians had gathered to throw sweets and kisses  at the new occupants.
Dressed in olive-green uniforms of the PLA, Kalashnikov rifles over their  shoulders, the police looked stunned by it all.
They appeared one by one to acknowledge the cheers and receive the kisses  from the surging crowd.
Abed decided it was a "historic" day for celebration and did not bother  going to his job in a supermarket at the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim,  between Jerusalem and Jericho.
"Mazel Tov, Mabruk," he shouted, happy to mix the Hebrew and Arabic words  for congratulations.
"I'm so happy. It's the first time we've seen our own soldiers,  Palestinians," Abed yelled.
Arab women gave voice to the shrill ululations of joy heard throughout the  Middle East. They sang, they clapped and laughed.
"My heart is filled with joy to see our policemen, who are our children,  our brothers, our cousins," said 20-year-old Sabah Atrabhanah.
She said she would pray for the release of all the Palestinian prisoners  "so that peace will come at last with the Jews."
Israel is to release about 4,000 prisoners in the coming weeks after  setting more than 1,000 last week in line with the autonomy agreement.
Throughout the town strangers and friends embraced to mark the occasion.
On Allenby Bridge street, near the police station, several new policemen  stood guard.
Cars pulled up to make sure of what they saw. Pasengers would climb out  and hug the guards.
Further down the road, near the court, men, women and children queued up  to have their photographs taken with police officers. A Kalshnikov was handed  from a little boy to a grandmother for the family album.
A captain from the PLA's Al-Aqsa unit was on duty outside the court.
After 27 years in exile, he had not yet had time to go to find his family  and friends. "It doesn't matter. I've got plenty of time now," he said.
However not everyone joined in the party in the town of 15,000.
"We want to see all the West Bank liberated," said Samy el-Muthafar. "And  until that is done, the Palestinian uprising will continue," the unemployed  21-year-old said.

The US currency was firmer against the main  European currencies on Friday morning, as the market waited for publication of  US retail prices later in the day for further indications on inflation.
By midmorning, the greenback was trading at 1.6730 marks from 1.6675 at  the Thursday close, and at 104.70 yen from 104.20.
Despite figures on Thursday showing US wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent  in April, the market was still expecting an imminent rise in US interest  rates, said an analyst at JP Morgan.
A rise of 50 basis points "should be sufficient to support the dollar" he  said, adding: "If the market is disappointed by the US Federal Reserve,  central bank intervention will probably not be sufficient to prevent the  currency slumping to between 1.64 and 1.65 marks."
Dealers believe next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market  Committee could take action on short-term interest rates.
The Bank of Spain cut its key interest rate by 0.25 percent to 7.50  percent in the wake of similar rate cuts by other central banks this week. The  peseta, however, remained stable at 82.40 pesetas to the mark from 82.57 on  Thursday.
In the wake of Bank of Portugal's 0.25-point rate cut to 10.75 percent on  Thursday, the escudo reamined firm at 103 escudos to the mark from 103.25 at  the pervious close.
By midmorning, the mark was trading at 3.4278 French francs from 3.4292 at  the previous close and at 956.5 lire from 956.9.
The day after the death of John Smith, leader of Britain's Labour party,  sterling remained firm on uncertainty about a future leader, which helps the  currently unpopular ruling Conservative party ahead of the European elections.
The pound was trading at 1.4985 dollars from 1.4995 at the Thursday close,  at 2.5070 marks from 2.5004, 156.89 yen from 156.25, 2.1421 Swiss francs from  2.1386, and at 8.5883 French francs from 8.5753.
The greenback was trading at 1.6730 marks from 1.6675, at 104.70 yen from  104.20, 1.4295 Swiss francs from 1.4262, and at 5.7313 French francs from   5.7188.
In Paris, the dollar was marginally higher at 1.6725 marks from 1.6685 at  the Wednesday close, while the French franc remained stable. Markets were shut  on Thursday for the Ascension holiday.
By midmorning, the greenback was trading at 104.65 yen, and at 5.7325  French francs from 5.7220 at the Wednesday close.
The French franc remained little changed at 3.4280 francs to the mark from  3.4303 on Wednesday.
The pound was higher at 8.5864 French francs from 8.5451 at the Wednesday  close.

A Spanish fighter plane on NATO  maneuvers crashed into the Mediterranean Friday after one of its engines  caught fire but the pilot managed to eject and was unhurt, the Spanish Defense  Ministry said.
The pilot of the Harrier was quickly rescued by a Spanish Navy helicopter.
His plane, taking part in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's  so-called Dynamic Impact exercises, went down off Majorca, near the tiny  island of Cabrera, part of the Balearic Islands off Spain's east coast.
The ministry said when the pilot realized an engine was on fire, he tried  to head back to an air base at Palma de Majorca but finally had to bail out.

China exceeded by 171 percent its 1993 export  quota set by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), but has  pledged to keep exports below 20,000 tonnes this year to fulfil its commitment  as a new member, ATPC said Friday.
China exported 40,700 tonnes, exceeding the 15,000-tonne limit it agreed  to keep to last year, ATPC said in a communique at the end of its three-day  35th executive committee meeting here.
"Beijing had exported about 9,750 tonnes in the first quarter of this year  and has indicated it will keep its exports to within 20,000 tonnes for 1994,  since it has already signed up to be a member," an ATPC official said.
China, the world's largest tin producer, joined the 10-year old ATPC in  Bangkok on April 29 as the association's eighth member. Its membership  officially comes into effect June 29, ATPC said.
Brazil, the world's number two tin producer and represented at the meeting  by four members from the Parana Panema mining body, is an observer in the ATPC.
But it is cooperating with a supply rationalisation scheme ATPC launched  in 1987 to expedite depletion of surplus stocks and hasten a recovery of tin's  depressed prices.
"Brazil said its government has achieved control over Garimpeiro (illegal  mines) tin mining operations, especially in the Bom Futuro region. This should  enable Brazil to expedite her entry into the ATPC in the near future," the  official said.
Tin closed on Friday one sen higher at 14.09 Malaysian ringgit a kilo (2.2  pounds) on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market.
ATPC officials said China's excessive exports last year had led to a  reaccumulation of the rocketing excess stocks, exacerbated by continuing large  disposals by the United States Defence Logistics Agency (USDLA) and new  supplies from non-ATPC members such as Peru, Portugal, Russia and Vietnam.
The ATPC had declined to provide an update of the global excess, which is  unofficially estimated at 38,700 tonnes at the end of March, beyond saying:  "With China's closer cooperation, and if the USDLA keeps disposals down, there  would be significant depletion this year."
ATPC, which has as members Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Nigeria, Thailand and Zaire, accounts for 67 percent of the world's supply of  tin.
While tin industry experts have called for Brazil's membership, saying it  would be more meaningful if it came on board after China, ATPC officials said  Brazil's 1993 export of 23,100 tonnes was 3.8 percent below the agreed limit.
"Brazil's export of 4,500 tonnes for the first three months of the year  was 10.8 percent below its agreed limit for the period," the official said.
Output of ATPC members last year of 73,268 tonnes was 20.7 percent below  its agreed limit, while production of 14,258 tonnes for the first quarter of  the year was 26.9 percent below target, officials said.
"Producers would continue efforts to urge the US government to have a  mutually-agreed long term disposal-plan such that market disruptions could be  minimised when the USDLA disposes of tin," the official said.
ATPC is expected to formulate a more effective approach at its ministerial  conference in Bangkok scheduled for September 19-20, to be preceded by an  executive committee meeting from September 12-16, he said.

The move came a day after Chinese authorities released two dissidents but  arrested a third, sending mixed signals to Washington some three weeks ahead  of President Bill Clinton's decision on renewing China's most favoured nation   trade status.
Zhang Ruiyu, a Chinese dissident sentenced to four years' jail in 1991,  was released on parole and dissident intellectual, Yu Haocheng, was given  permission to go to the United States.
But in Shanghai police arrested Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese  Association for Human Rights.
Yang's arrest was the fifth in a month in Shanghai and confirmed  observers' beliefs that the release of some dissidents would not affect the  repression of others ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen  massacre.
Another dissident, Wei Jingsheng, is under police watch in a state-owned  residence in a Beijing suburb, according to family members.
In April, well-known dissident Wang Juntao was allowed to travel to the  United States for medical treatment, after being thrown in prison for  involvement in the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
Wang had been sentenced to 13 years imprisonment, receiving the harshest  penalty given to any leader connected to the movement.
Also Thursday the daughter of Bao Tong, the most senior Chinese official  arrested after the pro-democracy demonstrations, said her father had been  transfered from prison to a Beijing hospital about a month ago.
Bao, 62, an economist and former top aide to disgraced Communist Party  chief Zhao Ziyang, is serving a seven-year sentence imposed in 1992 for  "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement" and "leaking important state  secrets" during the 1989 demonstrations.

The battle for the Rwandan capital Kigali between  rebels and government forces raged on Friday as the United Nations said aid  workers had discovered 88 bodies of victims of a new massacre in the south.
Abdul Kabia, spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (MINUAR),  said relief workers found the recent victims of Rwanda's bloodletting on  Thursday (eds: correct) in the Butare region.
"We thought that massacres in the Butare region had stopped, but it seems  they are continuing," Kabia said.
He was unable to say who had carried out the slaughter, which was another  instance of more than a month of genocide among the minority Tutsi people and  the majority Hutus, estimated to have claimed almost 200,000 lives.
Early Friday, shellfire and gunfire of every kind could be heard in the  capital of the central African highland nation, apparently coming mainly from  rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) positions near the Meridien hotel.
Small arms fire went on into the day in several parts of the strife-torn  city, while Kabia said there was shooting and occasional mortar fire around  the road leading out towards the airport.
Pro-government forces were also fighting the predominantly Tutsi RPF on  Friday at Ruhengeri in the northwest of the country and at Bugesera in the  south, Kabia added.
Rwanda plunged back into civil war between the RPF, drawn mainly from the  Tutsi minority, and the Hutu-dominated army and pro-government militias after  Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspected rocket attack on  his plane on April 6.
Aid agencies estimate that some 200,000 people have been slain in  wholesale ethnic bloodshed during the weeks that followed, amid a massive  humanitarian tragedy.
Hundreds of thousands of others have fled abroad and face dire conditions  in camps in Tanzania, Burundi and other neighbouring countries, while some  20,000 people are prisoners sheltering in a church, a stadium and other  buildings in their own capital, in need of food and terrified for their lives.
Late Thursday, French former minister for humanitarian action and founder  of the charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors without Borders) Bernard  Kouchner arrived in Kigali by road from the Ugandan capital Kampala.
Kouchner met rebel leader Paul Kagame, who has expressed his determination  to take the capital, and said he also planned to meet other Rwandan leaders as  part of an assessment mission.
With the evacuation of the wounded, orphans and displaced people at the  centre of his preoccupations, Kouchner said: "I'm here wearing my own hat.  That's to say none at all."
Last month, 170 injured people, mainly Tutsis, were slaughtered in a  Butare hospital by members of the Hutu presidential guard. Hutu militia forces  early in May killed 13 Red Cross volunteers and 21 orphans who had been taken  from Kigali to Butare in the belief that they would be safer there.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked the UN Security  Council substantially to reboost UNAMIR, which was originally sent to help  implement a peace signed in August last year but cut back from 2,500 to just  400 men after the renewed violence broke out.

"There will be about 1,500 (policemen) when we are at full strength," said  the Palestinian general who had been based in Iraq until last week.
About a dozen buses and jeeps brought over the ex-soldiers of the PLA who  stuck Palestinians flags and pictures of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat on their  rifles.
"I'm so happy to be back in Palestine," shouted one officer. "I want to  plant flowers and olive trees.
"There's been enough death, enough killing. We want peace," he said.
Jericho is the first autonomous town on the West Bank.
The size of the enclave is still in dispute but Israel has set the area at  62 square kilometres. It does not include any Jewish settlement and houses  about 15,000 people.

Sudanese President Omar el Beshir on Friday blamed  rebel leader John Garang and "foreign intervention" for the country's  lingering civil war, and said Garang never kept promises made during peace  talks.
Addressing reporters here ahead of a new round of talks to open Monday in  the Kenyan capital, Beshir said: "The problem here is Garang personally."
He said it was easier to negotiate with Riek Mashar, Garang's former  deputy in the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) who broke away in  1991 to form an SPLA splinter group called SPLA United.
With Riek's faction, Beshir said agreements remained valid, whereas  Garang's group went back on its commitments.
"With Garang's group ... they do not recognise the agreements which we  reached in each session of negotiations," said Beshir, the leader of Sudan's  Islamic fundamentalist military government which is fighting mainly Christian  and animist southern rebels.
"In negotiations with other groups, we find that we negotiate on all  issues on the agenda and everything that we agree on continues to be valid,"  Beshir said.
Riek's split from Garang triggered an internal war between the two  southern factions, divided along tribal lines.
Riek has repeatedly denied Garang's accusations that he grants government  soldiers safe passage through his territory to attack Garang's troops.
Beshir, in Nairobi for the African Development Bank's 30th anniversary  celebrations, will not take part in the forthcoming peace talks, at the which  the government will be represented by parliamentary speaker Mohamed al-Amin  Khalifa.
Riek and Garang will send a joint delegation, and both were expected to  attend the opening session Monday, according to rebel sources.
Khartoum launched a massive offensive against the south at the beginning  of the year, sending warplanes and tens of thousands of soldiers against the  rag-tag rebel guerrillas.
Khartoum apparently conceived the offensive as a final push to crush the  southern rebellion draining its already overstretched coffers, diplomats said.
But the government forces seem to be have got bogged down and have failed  to drive the rebels out of the south or cut their supply lines from Uganda.
Beshir also blamed the rebels for a failure to agree on opening safe  corridors for relief supplies to millions of southerners hit by famine,  stemming mainly from the displacement of huge populations by the decades-old  conflict between north and south.
Beshir said one of main obstacles to peace was "foreign intervention," by  unnamed countries bankrolling the rebels. "The leaders of the rebel movements  do not control their decisions," he said.
He added that a dispute with Eritrea, which last year accused Sudan of  sponsoring Islamic fundamentalist groups that launched cross-border raids into  Eritrea, had been resolved.
He blamed an Eritrean faction opposed to the country's government for the  attacks and said Sudan had curtailed its activities following talks with  Eritrean representatives who recently visited Khartoum.

Boxing legend Muhammad Ali has passed on one of the  secrets of his success to young Vietnamese aspirants, advising them not to  sleep with their girlfriends three weeks before a bout.
The former three times heavyweight boxing champion was warmly received  late Thursday by boxing hopefuls at a training centre in the Vietnamese  capital.
Ali is known here for having refused military service during the Vietnam  War. He was stripped of his first world heavyweight title in 1970 because of  it.
But encouraged by the enthusiasm shown by young boxers here, the  52-year-old Ali who suffers from Parkinson's disease was carried back to his  years as a famous pugilist, displaying punch combinations and testing the  reflexes of his admiring fans.
"You have the potential to become good boxers and everbody I met today is  fast," he said after meeting with about 20 youths, who challenged him as  sparring partners, and passing on some advice.
Ali said he was willing to help Vietnam develop boxing and sponsor  meetings between amateurs here and in the United States.
Ali has been on a goodwill mission here since Tuesday aimed at assisting  in settling the fate of 2,234 US soldiers still listed as missing in action  since the war.
He was accompanied here by the families of two American pilots who were  lost in action over the border with Laos, and asked Vietnamese authorities to  approach their Laotian counterparts in resolving the pilots' cases.
On Thursday, Ali told Minister of Youth and Sports Ha Quang Du that he had  made the right decision "in refusing to serve in Vietnam."
Ali is scheduled to leave Vietnam Saturday after visiting Danang on Friday.

China has released five Christians from  re-education camps, the official news agency Xinhua reported Friday, a day  after the authorities announced that a jailed Roman Catholic dissident had  been freed on parole.
They were identified as Chen Zhuman, Yan Peizhi, Xu Zhihe, Cui Tai and  Zhang Li.
The five had been sentenced to re-education in Fujian province,  southeastern China, Shandong, in the east and Hebei in the north for having  "disturbed public order and endangered public security by their religious  activities," the agency said.
The move came a day after Chinese authorities released two dissidents but  arrested a third, sending mixed signals to Washington some three weeks ahead  of President Bill Clinton's decision on renewing China's most favoured nation   trade status.
Zhang Ruiyu, a Chinese dissident sentenced to four years' jail in 1991,  was released on parole and dissident intellectual, Yu Haocheng, was given  permission to go to the United States.
But in Shanghai police arrested Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese  Association for Human Rights.
Yang's arrest was the fifth in a month in Shanghai and confirmed  observers' beliefs that the release of some dissidents would not affect the  repression of others ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen  massacre.
Another dissident, Wei Jingsheng, is under police watch in a state-owned  residence in a Beijing suburb, according to family members.
In April, well-known dissident Wang Juntao was allowed to travel to the  United States for medical treatment, after being thrown in prison for  involvement in the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
Wang had been sentenced to 13 years imprisonment, receiving the harshest  penalty given to any leader connected to the movement.
Also Thursday the daughter of Bao Tong, the most senior Chinese official  arrested after the pro-democracy demonstrations, said her father had been  transferred from prison to a Beijing hospital about a month ago.
Bao, 62, an economist and former top aide to disgraced Communist Party  chief Zhao Ziyang, is serving a seven-year sentence imposed in 1992 for  "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement" and "leaking important state  secrets" during the 1989 demonstrations.

A German company which organises summer language  courses for young Germans has asked families putting them up not to serve beef  to their guests, a spokesman said Friday.
Europartner said it feared that parents, worried by the German  government's campaign against British beef imports, would refuse to send their  children to Britain.
Bonn is concerned because bovine spongiform encephalopathy, so-called "mad  cow" disease, can be transmitted to man. The majority of cases in cattle have  been detected in Britain.
Several hundred families who regularly welcome students into their homes  in the summer holidays have received a letter to that effect.
"There is a lot of media coverage about mad cow disease in Germany at the  moment and many people are very nervous about it. There was a real concern  that there may be a mass cancellation of bookings, and Europartner has to  remain competitive" spokeswoman Jennie Parsons said.
The German authorities have threatened to take unilateral measures to  drastically limit imports of British beef unless the European Union reaches an  agreement on the problem by the end of May.

Syria warned Friday it still insisted on a total  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and was sceptical ahead of US Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's second peace shuttle in a month.
"Any settlement not based on the central issue of land is useless," an  official in Damascus said.
The official, asking not to be named, charged that Israel had "minimized  the US role by reducing it to a mere postman delivering the Israeli point of  view without any amendment."
The Israelis, during Christopher's last shuttle between Israel and Syria  earlier in May, had proposed "security arrangements before a peace treaty,  then a phased withdrawal over a long period," he said.
But any peace deal with Israel depended on a full withdrawal from the  Golan Heights, which the Jewish state seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle  East and later annexed.
"Syria will not accept anything less than a total pullout from the Golan  and southern Lebanon," the official newspaper Ath-Thawra said.
The task facing Christopher, who arrives here on Sunday before travelling  to Israel, is to "tone down the Israeli position and ensure the implementation  of UN resolutions" on land-for-peace, it added.
"It's important to keep the process moving forward," a State Department  spokesman said Wednesday.
"I don't think that it is the secretary's expectation to make a major  breakthrough on this trip or any trip for some time. There will be a lot of  trips," said Michael McCurry.
A sceptical Syrian press snapped up the comments. "This pessimism ... is  the result of Israel's negative stand and the king of proposals and ideas that  it submitted to Syria," said Ath-Thawra.
Christopher is expected to deliver an Israeli response to Syrian proposals.
After his last shuttle in early May, he believed Syria and Israel were  moving into a new phase in their discussions.
But Syria rejected an Israeli plan for a phased withdrawal over a period  five to 10 years, although Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara has said his  country's position was "neither obstinate nor extremist."
The length of Christopher's latest mission is flexible, depending on  whether he makes progress, according to the State Department.

Japan's Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. Ltd. suffered a  special loss of 130 billion yen (1.25 billion dollars) in the year to March  after writing off bad loans by six affiliates, industry sources said Friday.
The industry sources said the writeoffs were the the first ever by a  Japanese life insurance company and offset by sales of property and securities  which raised some 80 billion yen.
Sumitomo's unrealised gains on property and securities holding at the end  of March were estimated at being some 25 times larger at 2,000 billion yen.

Japanese bank lending in April grew 0.3 percent from  a year earlier, down from 0.5 percent in March and a record low which  reflected banks writing off non-performing loans, the Bank of Japan said  Friday.
Demand for funds is unlikely to recover in the short term as bigger  companies continue to restrain capital spending, a central bank official said.
Another factor behind the weak demand for loans is the tendency of  companies to bypass their banks and borrow directly from financial markets, he  said.
The official said growth in lending would have been 0.4 percent if the  impact of write-offs and the stronger yen were excluded.
Advances by city banks grew 0.1 percent in April, down from 0.4 percent in  March, while advances by trust banks plunged 2.7 percent, surpassing the  previous a 2.2 percent decline. The drop in lending by long-term credit banks  also eclipsed the March figure, falling 0.4 percent compared with 0.3 percent.
Lending by regional banks rose 1.9 percent, down from two percent in  March, and loans by second-tier regional banks rose 1.6 percent, up from 0.8  percent.
Advances by foreign banks plunged 22.3 percent, exceeding the 18.5 percent  decline recorded in March, the central bank said.

After seven boom years, Malaysia is now  fighting inflationary pressures exacerbated by rising spending and  profiteering, analysts said Friday.
A marathon effort to fight inflation is underway through a national  campaign to be launched by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Thursday, which  aims to curb excessive price hikes and get "every Malaysian consumer" to spend  less.
The inflation rate of 3.6 percent last year was considered relatively low,  given the country's 8.5-percent economic growth rate, but analysts said  soaring wages, ample liquidity and arbitrary price increases are putting  pressure on prices.
Most economists have predicted inflation will rise to 4.2 percent this  year and 4.5 percent in 1995.
"There is a psychological trend among our traders that prices of goods  must go up every few months regardless of whether there is a genuine rise in  inflation," said Ramon Navaratnam, the chief executive of Bank Buruh.
The inflationary trend was reflected by the overall 7.4-percent hike in  prices of non-controlled foodstuffs in the first quarter, compared to the  corresponding period last year, said Navaratnam.
"These price increases are domestically generated and not import-inflated.  Therefore, there should have been more countervailing action to stop them,"  Navaratnam said.
A precursor of the main anti-inflation campaign was the classification on  Wednesday of bread as a controlled item to expand an inventory of essential  consumer goods of which the price cannot be raised without government approval.
Analysts said the dynamic growth of the Malaysian economy over the last  seven years, at an average rate of eight percent a year, had led to an  estimated 70- to 100-percent surge in the income of Malaysia's middle and  upper classes since 1987.
The boom had also brought an influx of foreign funds meant for capital and  money market investments, officials said.
The Malaysian banking system alone enjoyed a surplus of 7.8 billion  ringgit (2.9 billion US) from total desposits of 9.8 billion ringgit last year  while the overall money supply grew by five percent, officials said.
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last week he was confident that a  series of measures imposed by the central bank in January to mop up liquidity  and deter foreigners speculating in the ringgit would help to cap inflation.
Bank Negara, the central bank, had increased the statutory reserve  requirements (SSR) of financial institutions and disallowed commercial banks  from undertaking non-trade related swaps and foreign transactions with  foreigners under the measures.
It also imposed negative interest rates on the vostro accounts of foreign  banks here but this was revoked on Wednesday, although the SSR was raised a  further one percent to 10.5 percent to control liquidity.
"The higher SSR could effectively remove some 1.5 billion ringgit from the  financial system monthly," said Navaratnam.

Rival Yemeni troops battled Friday for control of a  key town north of Aden, as an Arab League team issued an urgent appeal for a  ceasefire in the week-old civil war.
Northern troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh and southern forces  backing Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid were locked in a grim struggle for Al  Daleh, which lies near the former border between the old North and South Yemen.
The Sanaa authorities announced Thursday said the town had fallen, and a  military spokesman said here Friday that "pockets of resistance" were being  mopped up.
Northern reinforcements had been dispatched to Al-Daleh, which lies 90  kilometres (50 miles) north of Aden on a key road to a southern air base.
But military sources in Aden said southern troops had launched a  counter-offensive and recaptured some positions around Daleh.
There was also another battle underway in the Kharaz region, 120  kilometres (75 miles) west of Aden.
The defence ministry in Sanaa said northern forces were advancing and had  inflicted heavy losses on a rival armoured brigade.
But as the rival communiques continued to fly, southern commander Colonel  Ali Qassem Taleb said that the northern offensive through Kharaz had been  beaten back and the region was controlled by Baid's men.
And as the fighting raged on, an Arab League mission was due to hold  urgent talks with Saleh.
Mohammed Bayraqdar, the league's military affairs chief, urged Yemen's  leaders to "immediately halt" the fighting and open a dialogue, which they  have so far refused to do.
He was to give the president a message to that effect from the League  secretary-general, Esmat Abdel Meguid.
Saleh and his northern leadership decided to oust Baid as vice president  last week and sacked several southern ministers, branding them "secessionists"  who should be put on trial.
Baid's side in the meantime has demanded the withdrawal of northern forces  from the south.
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has spoken by telephone with both Saleh and Baid,  and Gulf states have issued appeals for an end to the fighting, which has  shattered the fragile unity of Yemen, an impoverished country on the southern  tip of the Arabian peninsula.
As foreigners continued to flee the fighting, two air force C-130 troop  transports left the Philippines for Saudi Arabia on Friday to evacuate up to  700 Filipinos.
Another 580 Indians have been evacuated in the past two days from the  7,000- strong community in Yemen.
Evacuees airlifted from Sanaa by the British Royal Air Force told of their  experiences during a stopover in Larnaca, Cyprus.
A Hungarian neurosurgeon who asked not to be named said "medical supplies  are extremely low" at the main hospital in Sanaa, where he had been working.
He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were barely  functioning and virtually all the hospital's foreign staff -- mostly  Bulgarians and Indians -- had left.
About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few days ago.
The surgeon said some 15 Somali refugees caught in the crossfire were  admitted with serious bullet wounds, and "at least two of them died later."
The hospital was hit by electricity cuts and there was virtually no  maintenance, he said.
One of the Hercules pilots, Flight Lieutenant Nick Young, said  communications at Sanaa airport were "excellent" and praised the help offered  by the Yemeni authorities.
He said he saw no damage to the airport, despite reported bombing raids by  southern jets when the conflict erupted last week.
Oil engineers who were working for the US company Yemen Hunt Oil in the  Marib field east of Sanaa said about 200 oil workers had stayed behind to keep  operations at the field running. It produces up to 60,000 barrels of oil per  day.
More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since fighting  erupted.

London share prices here were slightly lower on  Friday morning, on the last day of the current account, after rising on  opening on the back of higher share and futures prices in New York.
By midmorning, the FT-SE 100 index in leading shares had dipped 2.4 points  to 3,134.8 -- a fall of 0.07 percent, after lifting 3.7 points on opening. In  Paris, the CAC-40 showed a rise of 0.65 percent to 2,190.98 points.
Dealers generally remained prudent ahead of US retail prices later in the  day, which will give further indications on US inflation.
In London, Unilever slumped 36 pence to 1,044 after lower-than-expected  first quarter results, which showed sluggish sales growth and continuing  problems in North America, particularly regarding detergents.
Insurance companies were firmer after a series of good quarterly results  published this week: Sun Alliance lifted four pence to 325 and Royal Insurance  was up four pence to 266.
Pharmaceuticals also lifted, particularly Wellcome, which rose five pence  to 584 after publication of a study in the Lancet medical journal showing that  post-operative infusion of its Panorex drug reduces the death and recurrence  rate for patients with colorectal cancer.
Glaxo rose five pence to 570 and Zeneca was up pence at 719.
Building stocks were mixed with English China Clays (ECC) down 17 pence at  479, while RMC Group were eight pence higher at 878.
Among the biggest falls was London Weekend Television, down 15 pence to  725.
In Paris, shares were higher, reassured by encouraging US wholesale prices  on Thursday and by a decline in the French 10-year borrowing rate to below the  seven percent barrier at 6.89 percent.
The bond market's June futures lifted 0.3 percent to 120.50.
LVMH was 1.34 percent higher, while Total was up 0.92 percent and  Eurotunnel 3.56 percent.

West European, Russian and US foreign ministers met  in Geneva Friday in a fresh effort to agree a workable peace plan for  Bosnia-Hercegovina and end the civil war in the former Yugoslav republic.
The ministers of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Russia and the  United States, together with a top official of the European Union, began their  talks shortly after 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) at the US embassy.
After two years of destruction and division leaving tens of thousands of  people dead, wounded or displaced, frustration at the failure of previous  peace proposals has marked the week's run-up to this high-level encounter.
France and its west European partners are set on wresting agreement from  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his Russian counterpart Andrei  Kozyrev for an agreed ceasefire and political settlement formula.
French foreign minister Alain Juppe, whose country has furnished the  largest contingent for the United Nations in Bosnia, has warned that the UN  forces will not weather another winter there without an agreed peace plan.
But the Clinton administration has been reluctant to see an existing  European settlement plan imposed on the Moslem-led government in Sarajevo.
The US Senate Thursday meanwhile voted to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia,  in a move to bolster the Bosnian government against the Belgrade-backed Serb  forces who have carved out their own "ethnically-cleansed" territory.
France and the United States have officially smoothed over their  differences of approach, after Juppe went to Washington for talks with  Christopher about the Bosnia situation.
The White House said Thursday they had a "common approach".
It said they agreed the Geneva meeting "offers an important opportunity  for the US, France and the international community to continue cooperative  efforts to press the parties to the conflict to negotiate a political  settlement".
Juppe for his part spoke of a "broad agreement of views".
The French minister indicated that a joint declaration expected to come out  of the Geneva meeting could call for a six-month ceasefire, offer a gradual  lifting of sanctions against Belgrade and deal with the division of territory.
The European plan apportions 51 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina to the  Croats and Moslems, and 49 percent for the Serbs, who through their war-gains  currently control about 70 percent.
But the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who under US auspices have separately  reached agreement to set up a federation within the former Yugoslav republic,  are now demanding 58 percent for this federation.
The president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb "parliament", Momcilo  Krajisnik, has rejected the deal cut in Vienna, declaring that "the percentage  of territory we each receive depends on many aspects of our struggle."
"Anything over 50 percent cannot be considered," Krajisnik said on a Serb  radio late Thursday, monitored by the Tanjug news agency in Belgrade.
A senior US official in Washington, who asked not to be named, also said  the Moslem-Croat deal was not in line with previous agreements.
Bosnia's vice-president Egup Ganic and prime minister Haris Silajdzic have  both arrived for a ceremony in Geneva Saturday with Christopher and Croatia's  foreign minister Mate Granic to formally mark the federation agreement.
Whatever the outcome of the Geneva meeting -- and diplomats have not been  very optimistic -- the whole Bosnian question will also be high on the agenda  of a meeting in Brussels Monday of European Union foreign ministers.

A man was killed Friday and his wife and two  children were wounded when an IRA bomb exploded as they were getting into  their their car in the Northern Ireland town of Lurgan, police said.
The man was a maintenance worker at the local police station.
The bomb, for which the Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed  responsibility, went off at 0720 GMT as the four were getting into their car  in Lurgan, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Belfast.
One of the children, a three-year old girl, suffered multiple fractures  and cuts to her face while her mother and nine-year-old brother were  hospitalized with lesser injuries.
Late Thursday, a 23-year-old Catholic man was shot and killed by suspected  Protestant militants in north Belfast and Sunday an elderly Catholic man was  murdered in his home in the western town of Dungannon by members of the  Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force.

GATT chief Peter Sutherland all but ruled out  Friday the possibility of China rejoining the world trade body by year's end,  labelling the schedule put forward by Beijing "extremely demanding."
While "encouraged" by three days of talks with senior foreign trade  officials here, Sutherland said China was some way from realising its aim to  be in at the inception of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which replaces  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on January 1.
"It is still going to be extremely difficult, with the best will in the  world, to achieve that timeframe," Sutherland said at a joint press conference  with Vice Foreign Trade Minister Gu Yongjiang.
"The time schedule is extremely demanding," he added.
In a further indication that China's plans may be frustrated, the GATT  secretary general emphasised that there was "no practical difference" in  whether China joined the WTO on "January 1, April 1 or June 1."
"Really, what we should be talking about is the likelihood of a  satisfactory outcome at the end of the day. The end of the day being not too  distant."
He also pointed out that the deadline was even closer than December, as  the negotiating parties would have to reach a substantive protocol agreement  on re-entry by June in order to have any hope of inducting China before  January 1.
China, which was a founding member of GATT but left after the communists  came to power in 1949, has repeatedly made it clear that it attaches great  political significance to readmission before the new year.
Sutherland said he had seen signs of "genuine will and flexibilty" from  the Chinese side during his visit, but added that doubts remained over the  transparency of China's foreign trade regime, especially its policies  governing import quotas, licences and standards.
"I do not wish to minimise the amount of additional discussion that has to  be undertaken," he said.
His remarks contrasted with Gu's assertion that China had already made  enormous efforts to comply with GATT requests for import tariff and non-tariff  reductions as well as increased transparency.
Gu, the chief Chinese negotaiator to the GATT, also accused some countries  of creating "political obstacles" to China's re-entry and making "excessive"  demands.
As China is not yet a developed nation, "it should undertake obligations  (to GATT) commensurate with the status of a developing country," Gu said,  adding that such commitments "must be within the economic affordability of our  country."
At the same time, he said he did not rule out the necessity of further  explanation and clarification of China's foregn trade regime in order to  address the concerns of GATT members.
Sutherland, however, dismissed as "simplistic" the labelling of countries  as either developed or developing.
While recognition will be given to the particular transitional status of  China's economy, "it is the balance of rights and obligations that will  ultimately determine the reality of China's status in the WTO," he said.
Sutherland also took issue with the assertion by Assistant Foreign Trade  Minister Long Yongtu that the United States was using the Sino-US row over the  renewal of China' Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status to hamper China's  GATT re-entry.
Long, who also participated in the press conference, said the US  insistence on linking MFN renewal with human rights was "a typical example of  political elements interfering with trade" and was holding up the GATT  negotiations.
But Sutherland appeared to disagree, saying the United States had assured  him that it was constructively and positively engaged in seeking a speedy  resolution to the issue of Chinese re-entry,
"I have absolutely no reason to believe that that represents anything  other than an accurate statement," he said.

An appeal court in this French southeastern  city Friday threw out an appeal by Mayor Michel Noir against a bail order  served when he was charged with embezzling public funds this year.
The court also upheld a judicial control order also served in March  against Noir, a prominent conservative politician alleged to have embezzled  one million dollars to finance his political activities.
The 49-year-old former trade minister and mayor of France's second largest  city was once viewed as potential presidential contender but his political  future dimmed after the March charges.
He was ordered at the time to put up bail of 2.4 million francs (420,000  dollars).
Noir's lawyers said they take the matter to a higher court.

Russian border guards Friday said they impounded a  vessel bound for Japan carrying 20 tonnes of illicit crab on board.
The unit's chief os staff, quoted by ITAR-TASS agency, said officers  boarded and impounded the "Okhta" when it took on the load from a shipping  trawler in the high seas after leaving a Sakhalin island port Thursday en  route for Japan.

A long handshake between two  generals and the Palestinians officially took control of Jericho on Friday,  sparking popular celebrations after 27 years under occupation.
Israel's central region military commander General Ilan Biran grasped the  hand of Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) General Hajj Ismail to mark the  transfer of power for the first autonomous enclave.
"I wish you good luck," Biran said. "All the best. I hope to coordinate  and to cooperate."
"Thank you," Ismail replied through an interpreter. "I hope we will be  successful together on the road to peace."
The ceremony took place by the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan with the  West Bank, after 386 Palestinian police crossed the River Jordan to Jericho.
Biran told reporters: "Part of our job is over, a new life is beginning.  We have handed over authority to their commanding officer."
Palestinian youths shouted "Allah u Akbar" (God is great) and pro-PLO  slogans.
Ismail said: "There are now 462 Palestinian policemen in Jericho. There  will be about 1,500 when we are at full strength," said Ismail, who was based  in Iraq until last week.
"This is a great and historic day thanks to the sacrifices of our people.
"We want peace and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from all the  occupied territories," he said.
A dozen buses and jeeps brought over the former soldiers of the PLA who  stuck Palestinians flags and pictures of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat on their  rifles.
"I'm so happy to be back in Palestine," shouted an officer. "I want to  plant flowers and olive trees. There's been enough death, enough killing. We  want peace."
The Palestinians had already raised their red, green, white and black flag  over Jericho before dawn. The Israelis handed over a series of buildings and a  military base to 60 police officers who slipped in overnight and Thursday.
Only half-a-dozen taxi-drivers witnessed the historic event. But word  spread fast and whole families poured on to the streets to hail their heroes.
Women ululated with joy as the celebrations got into full swing in the  ancient oasis on the edge of the Dead Sea.
Four Palestinian flags fluttered on the roof of the police station, which  until Thursday had been the target of stone-throwing children.
Now children through sweets and kisses at the Palestinian occupants.
"The Israeli flag had been brought down by the time we came in," said Ahmad  Abu Saadeh, a policeman who crossed over in the morning. "There were no more  Israeli soldiers left, we didn't shake hands with any of them."
The Palestinians also took over the main military adminstration building,  the post office, a court house, a military administration building and a  nearby synagogue.
Israeli soldiers were stationed a kilometer (half a mile) away, at the  junction of a road they will patrol Friday with the Palestinian police.
Israeli Colonel A, whose name was not revealed, told state radio: "As soon  as we have the green light it will only take us a few hours to pull out. We  will withdraw before sunset if all goes well."
The radio said Israeli citizens carrying arms would no longer be allowed  to enter the Jericho enclave, the size of which is still in dispute.
Israel has set the area at 62 square kilometres (37 sq. miles). It does  not include any Jewish settlement.
Palestinian police took control of the southern Gaza Strip on Friday as  hundreds more reinforcements arrived and the Israelis pulled out of their last  bastion.
"Everything south of the river is in the hands of the Palestinian police,"  a senior Israeli military official said.
The river, known as Wadi Gaza, cuts across the Strip south of the Jewish  settlement of Netzarim. Israeli forces however remain in charge of security of  the 4,000 settlers, most of whom live in the south of Gaza.
Security installations at Khan Yunes were handed over in the night. It was  the last town in the south to be evacuated following Deir el-Balah, Bureij,  Nusseirat and Rafah.
Facilities in Gaza City were to be handed over Sunday, PLO officials said,  and transfer of authority on the Strip completed by Wednesday.
Unlike the overcrowded Gaza Strip with a population of nearly 800,000, the  Jericho police are taking over a quiet oasis of 15,000 people, known as the  world's oldest and lowest town at 250 metres (825 feet) below sea level.
The police is due to have 9,000 men, 7,000 of them from PLA units  scattered across the Arab world, in line with the autonomy deal signed May 4.

The latest agreement between Russia and Ukraine on  sharing out the Black Sea fleet will fail, fleet commander Eduard Baltin said  Friday, warning of power cuts to some Ukrainian navy units.
The Russian admiral made the gloomy forecast to the Interfax news agency.  He said the Russian part of the naval command was getting ready to cut off  electricity to some Ukrainian navy units in the Crimea, because the Ukrainians  owed the fleet 4.5 billion rubles (2.5 million dollars).
It was not a political decision, since "one must not mix politics and  economic matters," he said.
Last month Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk concluded a new  agreement in principle on dividing the fleet, an issue which has bedevilled  bilateral relations since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the two sides  have failed since then to agree on practical measures.
"The April agreement will fail like all the previous ones," Baltin told  Interfax. He reiterated Russian opposition to letting Ukraine keep bases at  Sevastopol the fleet headquarters, saying it was "against all common sense and  has already aggravated tensions".
The port is in Crimea, which belongs to Ukraine but has a Russian majority  population.

The prosecutor's office here began an investigation   Friday into comments made by former Russian vice president Alexander Rutskoi  to determine whether he should be held liable for his recent calls to  overthrow the current regime.
Moscow's prosecutor, Guennady Ponomaryev, was instructed to "begin making  verifications concerning illegal events that occurred May 9," when a gathering  of radical opponents to President Boris Yeltsin was organized, the  prosecutor's office said in a communique carried by Interfax.
The investigation will focus on comments Rutskoi made during the gathering  as well as the burning of a Russian flag by one of the protesters and  anti-semitic statements.
Rutskoi at the time told the gatheriang of some 20,000 people that  Yeltsin's regime must be overthrown and he promised that the current  administration would be replaced within a year.
The Russian penal code includes articles forbidding offensive comments  against the leadership or calls to overthrow the government and anti-semitic  propaganda, a spokesman at the prosecutor's office said.
He added that the prosecutor "would use the full weight of the law to put  an end to these unconstitutional actions."
Rutskoi and various other leaders of the failed October 1993 revolt  against Yeltsin was amnestied by the new legislature in February.
Yeltsin, who opposed the amnesty, warned the revolt leaders at the time  that they would be arrested if they broke the law.
The revolt leaders refused last month to join a civic peace pact called  for by Yeltsin, which forbids political action that could lead to upheaval.

Karl Wendlinger's condition was described as  "stationary" here on Friday morning, the Austrian Formula One driver remaining  in a deep coma after his crash in Monaco on Thursday.
But the next two days are set to be crucial.
Wendlinger suffered head injuries when he crashed during a practice  session for the Monaco Grand Prix. He appeared to brake late coming out of the  tunnel, the fastest point on the street circuit.
Andre Falcy, the deputy head of Nice's university hospital, quoting  Professor Dominique Grimaud who is in charge of the unit caring for  Wendlinger, would only say that the Austrian's "state of health is stationary."
However, a doctor speaking on grounds of anonymity told AFP: "Wendlinger  is bound to suffer major functional after-effects, but if he pulls through the  next 48 hours, he could come out of this alive."
Wendlinger's parents arrived here overnight by car, and went immediately  to their son's bedside.
A medical bulletin on the Austrian was due to be issued later in the day.
The accident came two weeks after Brazil's triple world champion Ayrton  Senna and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger were killed at the San Marino Grand  Prix.

A huge blaze Friday gutted much of  Lucerne's historic 14th century tower, the Schimerturm, city officials said.
It took 150 firemen about an hour to extinguish the fire which broke out  just before dawn, sending flames licking 30 metres (yards) high, firemenn said.
The old stones of the tower, part of the city's ancient fortifications,  remained standing but the wooden bowels of the structure were totally  destroyed, officials said.
It was the second blaze in nine months to gut an historic building in the  city. In August, the Kappellbruecke -- a wooden-covered bridge -- was ravaged  by a blaze. It was rebuilt and reopened a few weeks ago.

A Palestinian policeman stood  guard outside the ancient synagogue of Jericho on Friday, pledging it would  remain open to Jews under Palestinian self-rule.
"This is a sacred place of religion," said Lieutenant Abu el-Abed as he  stopped a Palestinian woman trying to place a flag at the entrance.
"I hope there will not be any problem. This is a place of worship, open to  all in our land, Palestine."
Jewish settlers, enraged by the inclusion of the synagogue in the  autonomous zone, have staged protest sit-ins, and had to be forcibly removed  by Israeli police.
The Shalom al Israel (Peace upon Israel) synagogue was one of the last  sites in Jericho to be transferred to Palestinian authority on Friday as  hundreds of policeman arrived to take charge.
Out of respect, there will be no Palestinian flag fluttering over the  building.
Just before the last Israeli soldiers had pulled out of the synagogue set  in fields away from the town, three die-hard Jewish settlers showed up to pray  and show the place was still theirs, despite Palestinian self-rule.
When the soldiers refused to let them in, they produced scissors and cut  up their clothes.
"We do this by tradition," said one of the three men, who had driven down  from the Ofra settlement, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Jericho.
"It means that we are in mourning, or that we have given up land to the  enemy."
Under the self-rule deal, the Byzantine-era synagogue will be administered  in coordination with Jewish religious authorities. A synagogue employee is to  hold the key to the building, which houses 5th-6th century mosaics.
The site will open daily, including the Friday-Saturday Jewish Sabbath,  said a Palestinian officer.
The army declared the synagogue off-limits, and regional commander General  Ilan Biran declared Jericho a military closed zone until the completion of the  handover.
The general said it was to "stop Israelis hostile to the peace process  creating trouble, because this town has become a symbol of autonomy in the  West Bank."
Joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols are to guard the roads around the  religious site.

Next year's Cannes Film Festival -- the  48th -- has been ousted from its normal mid-May slot to make way for France's  presidential elections, festival sources said Friday.
The world's largest filmfest will take place from May 17-28 next year, a  week later than its usual prime position in the calendar of the world's film  industry.
The exact dates of the French presidential election has not been fixed.  The first round is due to take place at the end of April, with the second  round two weeks later.
The Cannes International Film Festival traditionally starts on a Thursday  in the second week of May, and finishes with the selection of the winner of  the Golden Palm on the Monday 11 days later.

Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera has completed  his first 100 days in office with protests shaking the capital and a somber  economic outlook fed by a 25 percent plunge in the currency in over a week.
Caldera took office on February 2, just days before the country was hit by  a banking and financial crisis that started in Banco Latino, the  second-largest bank in the country, and up to now has cost the government 5.3  billion dollars to keep in check.
"The government's hands are tied by an inherited economic crisis it has  only managed to tackle with band-aids, while the macro-economic problem goes  unaddressed," a businessman told AFP.
While Venezuelans were eagerly awaiting his new economic plan, Caldera  issued a decree suspending economic safeguards and -- against the advice of  experts -- caved in to protests and lifted a highly unpopular consumer tax  that had gone into effect on January 1.
In its place, Caldera instituted a tax reform that included higher taxes  on wholesale and luxury items and bank borrowing. To do this he managed to get  a law through Congress giving him a free hand in economic matters until next  week.
But despite Caldera's relative success in the political arena and in  maintaining a positive public image, analysts predict the economic reality and  its social repercussions will soon catch up with him.
A government budget deficit that equals 10 percent of gross domestic  product (GDP) and a sustained drop in oil prices have forced the government to  consider subsidizing the oil industry which runs up more than 300 million  dollars in losses a year.
But raising gasoline prices conjures up the horrors of February 1989, when  higher fuel prices led to higher public transport fares igniting riots that  killed 250 people -- more than 1,000 according to human rights groups -- and  caused millions of dollars in damage.
This week, even without a rise in gasoline prices, students rioted because  of a government failure to live up to plans to offer students discounted bus  fares and hundreds of government workers marched to demand pay rises promised  by Caldera's predecessor.
Some 15,000 court employees went on strike to protest the government's  failure to deliver promised pay raises and agricultural workers have  threatened to stop work and block provincial highways next week if their debts  with private banks cannot be refinanced.
Caldera, who was president from 1968 to 1972, also had another success:  even before he was inaugurated, Caldera successfully asked for the  resignations of the top military command because of their opposition to  pardoning officers who participated in attempted coups in February and  November 1992.
In three months, he stopped the cases against nearly all the officers  imprisoned for the uprisings, including the the leader of the first attempted  coup, commander Hugo Chavez, most of whom have been released.
Despite this success and the perception that Caldera's new government is  free of corruption, voters are still uncertain about their future.
"Honesty doesn't put food on the table," a passerby told AFP.

Taiwan's entry in the official competition  at the Cannes Film Festival tells a story of cultural confusion in Asia, but  which will be appreciated worldwide, its director told AFP Thursday.
Edward Yang, speaking an hour before the premiere of "A Confucian  Confusion" here, said the film was about a specific culture, but has far wider  resonances.
"I don't think its referring just to Taiwan, its referring to Hong Kong,  Korea, Japan and Singapore, all the confucian-influenced societies," he said  in an interview with AFP.
And he added: "If I've done a good job to tell a human story, then people  from other parts of the world will appreciate it ... I wouldn't be surprised  at it because were all human."
"That's why drama is so interesting because its about humanity not just  because were Chinese or French or British. It's a document to look back on in  the future," he said.
The movie, starring new faces Chen Xianqi, Ni Shujun and Wang Weiming,  tells the story of a group of 12 former schoolfriends living hectic  professional and romantic lives in Taipei.
The relentlessly urban setting -- much of the action is set in cars  driving from one apartment to another in downtown Taipei -- contrasts with key  artist characters who turn against the modern technological environment.
Yang says the polarity of the setting and characters relects the cultural  confusion felt by young people not only in Taiwan, but also other Asian  democracies.
"There's a dilemma whether you want to do more about your life or whether  you want to accept the intimidating pressure which puts you back in your  place," he said.
"This is basically what all these societies ... not the ones that are  still developing, but the ones that are already developed, like Taiwan, Hong  Kong, Japan, Korea .. pretty soon China is going to be in that position. This  is what is happening in Asia.
"The West hasn't really realized this culture change. Every one of these  states is trying to implement democracy," he added.
Yang, 47, is in the official competition on the Croisette for the first  time after an appearance in the Un Certain Regard section of the festival in  1987.
But he insists he is not intimidated by seeing his film premiered on the  first full day of the 47th Cannes International Film Festival -- the world's  biggest filmfest.
Above all he has no expectations of winning the top prize, the Golden  Palm, he says, admitting that he has not seen last year's Chinese winner, Chen  Kaige's "Farewell To My Concubine."
Asked how he rates his chances, he replies simply: "I don't. I'd be stupid  if I did. There's nothing I can do now. I've done my best to make the film.  I'm happy about it."
And is he nervous ahead of the public premiere? "No. After five years in  this business you know whats going on. There is nothing you can do about it  ... its not a big deal at all," he says.

A little boy screamed as he arrived at the Kigali  Red Cross hospital, covered in shrapnel wounds. Another boy's foot was wrapped  in a blood-soaked cloth and a one-month-old baby came in a cardboard box, his  face riddled with cuts.
The children, a group of eight brought to the hospital, were out alone on  the streets when the shell landed. No one knows where their parents are, or  whether they are even alive.
The eight were the latest victims in Rwandan's bloody conflict between  majority Hutus and minority Tutsis, which has left tens of thousands of people  dead since President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspicious plane  crash on April 6.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) set up its field  hospital soon afterwards, in a boarding school at the centre of the Rwandan  capital.
It runs the place with the help of the Paris-based medical aid group  Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders - MSF), mustering a staff of  eight foreigners and 125 local volunteers.
The hospital receives about 90 wounded people a week and currently has  about 260 patients, including 50 children, administrator Andre Musy explained.
The Red Cross has also opened a station near Gitarama, about 40 kilometres  (25 miles) south-west of Kigali, and supplies the city's main hospital with  medical supplies brought from neighbouring Burundi, or flown in from further  afield when the airport is not being bombed.
At the crowded main hospital, a little further up the hill, there are  about 1,200 civilian wounded and "a great number of soldiers," said Musy.
Even at the field hospital, they have set up tents on all the lawns to  cope with the large numbers.
Arrows on the wall point the way to the bomb shelters, which have already  been used several times.
Some tents, wedged between an embankment and a wall to protect them from  shells, are reserved for the children who have suffered every injury --  amputation, rape, beatings, bullet and shell wounds and machete cuts.
One little girl has only one arm, another boy's leg is cut below the knee.
"One day they brought us two children who had been playing together,"  remembered Rene, an MSF organiser. "One child had both feet cut off, the other  both hands."
Rene sang the children a rhyme in the Rwandan language Kinyarwanda. They  joined in, at first shyly, and smiled as they grew bolder.
"A child that smiles is a battle won," said Rene. "It is hard to win with  these children, most of whom have seen their families massacred."
The hospital's biggest problem right now is the water shortage, according  to ICRC delegation chief Philippe Gaillard. There is no running water in  Kigali, because of a shortage of aluminium sulphate which helps cut down  impurities.
"If we use the muddy water without this product, the plumbing will get  blocked up very quickly," said Gaillard. In the meantime, "everyone must make  economies and draw water where they can."
Big tanks have been set up under the gutters to catch rainwater and search  parties are being sent to the edges of the city.
Some of the hospital's wounded stay on even after recovery, homeless or  fearful of further massacres. Those who find a refuge leave. The Red Cross  does not chase the others away.

Boris Becker earned a free ride into the Italian Open  semi-finals here on Friday, when fellow German Michael Stich pulled out before  their quarter-final with back pains.
Stich, the world number two, had complained of "a cold in the back" after  Thursday's third-round victory over Moroccan surprise qualifier, Karim Alami.
On Friday, a report from tournament doctors said Stich was suffering from  "pain in the lower lumbar region and in both legs, with consequent loss of  muscle strength." They prescribed muscle relaxants and pain killers.
Becker and Stich have only met on clay once, two years ago in the  semi-finals at Hamburg, when Stich thrashed his compatriot 6-1, 6-1.
The semi-final was Becker's top career showing on clay, his least  favourite surface, although the three-times Wimbledon champion still has an  all-surface career record of 5-3 over Stich.
Becker has also won their last two matches -- at Wimbledon last year and  Stuttgart in February.
World number Pete Sampras was playing Italian Andrea Gaudenzi in the day's  opening match at the Foro Italico, basking in warm spring sunshine.
Gaudenzi advanced from the third round through injury to Austrian sparring  partner and seventh seed Thomas Muster, who also withdrew with back pains  during their first set while trailing 4-1.
Sampras has been through a solid tune-up this week during his first outing  on clay this year. The 22-year-old American is aiming for a long-shot victory  at the French Open, which would give him four Grand Slam titles in a row.
Goran Ivanisevic, who knocked out fellow big-server Richard Krajicek of  the Netherlands on Thursday, will take on another Dutchman, Jacco Eltingh, for  a place in the semis.
Second seeded American Jim Courier was to play Slava Doesdel of the Czech  Republic.

The graffiti on a school wall in Khagrachari said it  all: "Just like a black cannot become a white, a pahari (hill people) cannot  be a Bengali."
Twenty years since the fighting began here, peace in Bangladesh's  southeastern hill tracts region still seems an elusive proposition, regardless  of whether tribal Shanti Bahini rebels in India can agree with the government  on returning home.
Some 56,000 tribesmen languish in camps over the border in India's Tripura  state, their leaders sticking to demands for "autonomy and a separate entity"  for the 600,000 Chakma tribespeople living in the region, which has been  settled by Bengali-speakers from the densely-populated flatlands below.
For now, they have dropped the idea of an armed struggle, but warn that  they could re-adopt it if the current series of peace talks, initiated in  1991, were to fail.
Successive Bangladeshi governments have rejected the question of autonomy,  which for some tribals does not amount to demanding complete independence.
In the mid-1980s the government set up tribal-managed Hill District  Councils which work mainly to develop the region.
The three-district region of Bangladesh bordering India and Burma that is  the focus of the conflict has been the scene of intermittent bloody clashes  between government troops and rebels for the past 20 years.
Shantu Larma, the head of one rebel group, said the tribals were "not  fighting whimsically, but for the cause of our historically recognised rights  to our homeland."
Khisha, a tribal spokesman, warned that "the current policy of the  government can keep the situation calm temporarily, but (it) will burst again  in the future.
"The younger generation will burst in anger when they learn their father  is in jail, their brothers maimed or killed to protect their rights," he said.
The tribespeople fled their homes in 1986, alleging military persecution  in clashes which officialy left more than 2,500 people dead, but the toll is  widely believed to be much higher.
A military officer in Khagrachari hill district said the current process  for peace "has reached a point of no return" and that the ball was basically  in the court of the tribal leadership.
The two sides also accuse each other of violating the current ceasefire.
Upendra Lal Chakma, chairman of the Chakma Refugee Welfare Association,  recently said after visiting his home that his people still felt insecure and  some "major problems" would have to be solved.
The army officer accused some of the groups of wanting "to keep the  insurgency alive for their own interest," claiming the tribals were getting  "more than they deserve" in terms of education and other facilities.
Official sources said because of the insurgency the area was one of the  most developed in terms of roads, telecommunications and power compared to  other such towns in Bangladesh.
Tribal leader Khisha disagreed: "This development is not bringing good for  our people, but it is counter-insurgency under the cover of development," he  said.

Facing rising calls for action from the public  and Congress, the Pentagon has agreed to carry out a major clinical study of  the mystery illness affecting hundreds of Gulf War veterans.
The symptoms of the so-called "Persian Gulf Syndrome" have included  chronic fatigue, arthritis, insomnia, hair loss, nervous breakdowns,  respiratory problems and diarrhea. But doctors have been unable to trace the  causes of the ailments.
The National Institutes of Health said last month that the ailments could  not be traced to a specific disease or syndrome, but were were a series of  different diseases, some with common symptoms.
While the number of veterans affected is not known, some 20,000 combatants  have complained of health problems they claim are related to their service in  the 1991 conflict.
The problem has been aired at congressional hearings and some have  compared it to the syndrome attributed to the defoliant Agent Orange used in  the Vietnam War.
Some veterans contend the symptoms are the result of exposure to nerve gas  or to pills given to counteract the effects of nerve gas, although military  health officials have denied this.
Other suggested causes are pesticides, desert parasites or chemical or  biological agents released into the atmosphere by bombings or Iraqi weapons  installations.
A series of internal Defense Department studies showed similar symptoms  among soldiers exposed to fumes from oil wells set on fire in Kuwait.
"We have to provide a diagnostic explanation veteran by veteran," said  Stephen Joseph, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. "We are  obligated to do everything we can do to try to find what the cause of the  disease is."
The four-month studied at an unspecified cost is expected to involve a  detailed examination of all troops who served in the region and have  complained of symptoms.
Dr. Harrison Spencer, director or the Tulane School of Public Health and  Tropical Medicine, has been asked to review plans for the new study, and a  forum of other public health experts will advise officials on the matter.
"This is a very important step forward," said Representative Lane Evans,  chairman of a House Veterans Affairs subcommittee looking into the matter and  a critic of the US administration's handling of the matter.

The death rate from cancer and other diseases has  shot up around the Aral Sea in the last 30 years since cotton-growing started  to dry out the giant inland waterway, experts have warned here.
Salt content has tripled in the sea, situated between the former Soviet  central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, according to studies  quoted at conferences held recently in the Uzbek capital Tashkent.
As a result, infant mortality among the four million people living around  the sea has reached 60 per thousand births, compared to the western European  average of less than 10, and respiratory problems of all kinds are increasing.
Typhoid and hepatitis cases have increased by a factor of 30 since 1960  and a study carrried out in 1990 showed that the number of cancerous tumours  was three times the norm elsewhere in Kazakhstan.
Tuberculosis is endemic and serious skin deases affect tens of thousands  of people, studies showed. In addition, hospitals are ill equipped to cope  with the situation, with only a tenth of them supplied with running water.
At least the conferences -- one sponsored by the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation's scientific service, the other by the UN educational forum  UNESCO -- show signs of concern by the regional authorities, whom western  experts have long accused of apathy.
"The Aral Sea is becoming the obsession of humanitarian aid groups,".  commented one European expert based in Tashkent. "The Uzbek and Kazakh  governments have done nothing about research, while some 300 international  missions have followed each other over the last few years."
The problems started in 1960 when the Soviet authorities imposed mass  cotton cultivation -- a thirsty crop which dried up the deltas of the two  rivers feeding the Aral, the Amou Daria and Syr Daria.
Even now, 90 percent of the region's water goes to cotton monoculture,  according to a report published by the Uzbek authorities. The massive use of  chemical pesticides makes things even worse.
The Aral was once the world's fourth biggest inland sea.
But now its old intake of 108 cubic kilometres (65 miles) of water per  year has dried to a trickle of no more than 10 cubic kilometres, cutting its  volume by three-quarters and its surface by a half within 30 years.
"A distance of 110 kilometres (67 miles) separates the old shore from  current water banks, drying up land equal to the three Baltic states," said  one report by the Kazakh Ministry of Health.
So far, the solutions being proposed "are not serious," the European expert  said. One proposal, for example, involved building a canal 500 kilometres (300  miles) long, linking the Aral to the Caspian Sea, while another involves  diverting Siberian rivers.
"You need a commercial motivation to launch projects on this scale," the  western expert said, giving the Suez Canal as an example.

India opened up basic telephone services to   foreign and domestic private companies in a long-awaited telecom policy  unveiled Friday, taking the first step towards private phone networks.
The policy is aimed at meeting an eight-billion-dollar shortfall in the   nearly 14 billion dollars required to modernise India's antiquated telephone  system and provide a phone on demand to its citizens by the year 1996.
Ordinary Indians with no political influence and no money to pay bribes to  jump the queue now have to wait up to five years for a connection, which may  not even work when they get it.
Three million people are on the waiting list, which is growing by 15-20  percent every year, but the list is expected to vanish when foreign companies  bring their telecom dollars to provide phone services.
Communications Minister Sukh Ram told parliament the policy also was aimed  at bringing to India all sophisticated phone services available in advanced  countries and build a world-class network.
The long-awaited policy document, whose theme is "telecommunications for  all," was released on the eve of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's departure  for a visit to the United States.
Major US telecom firms such as US West and Motorola have been eagerly  waiting to enter the huge Indian market of nearly 900 million people, where  basic telephone services have been a government monopoly.
Hardware manufacture and value-added services, such as radio paging and  mobile cellular phone systems, have been thrown open.
The policy document said currently there was not even one telephone for  every 100 Indians against a world average of 10 for 100.
India's telephone distribution average per 100 persons is 0.8, compared to  1.7 in China, two in Pakistan and 13 in Malaysia. Tens of thousands of  villages have no phone connections.
By 2000, demand for telephones is expected to grow to 20 million in the  country, seen as the largest telecom market after China.
But the task of serving all Indians on the waiting list for a telephone  connection and meeting future demand is "beyond the capacity of government  funding and internal generation of resources," the policy document said.
It said the aim was to ensure that all the more than 500,000 villages in  India had a phone connection and that a public call office was available for  every 500 Indians by 1997.
Private phone companies would have to strike a balance between covering  urban and rural areas, the document said.
A company's track record, its technology, the commercial terms it would  offer and the ability to give the "best quality of service to the consumer at  the most competitive cost" would determine who gets New Delhi's approval.
Private investment would be supplemented by government efforts to raise  additional money to fund a rapid expansion and modernisation of the  telecommunications network.
The telecom policy also envisages allowing private companies to install an  exchange, operate it for a specific period and transfer it to the Department  of Telecommunications after recovering investment.
Foreign investors invited to put money in India under a 1991  liberalisation programme have often cited inadequate telecommunications as an  infrastructural bottleneck restricting their entry.
Local manufacturers of telephone instruments meanwhile complain that they  are burdened with large inventories because of the government's failure to  match the demand for connections.
Privatisation has been held up so far mainly because of political and  bureaucratic resistance, while the cash-strapped state phone network has found  it hard to raise money from the market to bankroll expansion plans.
Indians have patiently tolerated the shoddy government-run phone network  in the absence of an alternative. In Calcutta, a citizens' organisation has  held ritualistic burials for "dead" telephones that never work.

Clashes between rival political groups at one  South African gold mine and a crippling strike at another Friday dampened some  of South Africa's post-election euphoria.
Seven people died in three and a half weeks of political tension between  supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African  National Congress (ANC) at the Western Areas gold mine west of here, National  Union of Mineworkers (NUM) spokesman Jerry Majatladi said Friday.
Security forces under the new government moved swiftly Thursday to prevent  further clashes at Western Areas and confiscated up to eight tonnes of  homemade and traditional weapons from the mine hostel, Frans van Rensburg, a  spokesman for mine owners Johannesburg Consolidated Industries (JCI), said.
"The weapons were found inside the hostel and have now been destroyed," he  told AFP.
Majatladi said "politically motivated" fighting between IFP and ANC  supporters started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first all-race  elections.
He said one person was killed on April 17, two others died in fighting  during the April 26-29 poll and four were killed Wednesday.
Nelson Mandela's ANC won the election, ending more than 300 years of  white-minority rule.
The IFP of Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi came in third after the  National Party; members of the three parties make up the government of  national unity that was announced on Wednesday.
Because most miners stay in large hostels accommodating thousands of  people, ethnic and political differences often boil over and result in  violence.
Majatladi said the clashes flared at Western Areas mine when rival groups  tried to drum up support in the run-up to the April 26-29 election.
In one of the worst incidents, four miners were killed Wednesday in an  underground battle in the mine's south shaft between workers armed with axes  and picks before security forces moved in to help restore order, Majatladi  said.
The situation at the mine was quiet Friday ahead of peace talks between  the rival groups, he said.
Both Majatladi and Van Rensburg said the crisis would be resolved by the  miners and management and that they would not seek government intervention,  apart from calling in security forces to quell violence.
"It's none of our business," a spokeswoman for the new Department of  Labour said when asked if the government would intervene.
About 9,500 miners were still on strike Friday after defying a court order  Thursday that ordered them back to work at the Kloof gold mine near  Carletonville, 50 kilometres (32 miles) west of here, Majatladi said.
The owners of the Kloof mine, Gold Fields, estimated production loss since  the strike began on May 5 at around 25 million rands (6.8 million dollars) and  Friday ordered the strikers to return to work by Sunday.
Workers had downed tools eight days ago following the dismissal of NUM  branch chairman Jackson Mafika for allegedly intimidating workers during a  strike in March.

US-based Hughes Aircraft Co is to be awarded  a contract to supply satellite control equipment for Malaysia's first  telecommunications satellite, company officials said Friday.
Hughes is to seal the deal with Binariang, Sdn Bhd, the telecommunications  company licenced by the government to own and operate the Malaysia East Asia  Satellite (MEASAT), Binariang said.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will witness the signing of the deal  Tuesday, Binariang said, declining to provide details yet.
France's Arianespace is keenly vying to launch the 200 million US dollar  MEASAT, targetted for a September 1995 launch from French Guyana.
Malaysia's Telecommunications and Post Minister Samy Vellu Sanglimuthu  recently said Beijing was also vying for the launch contract.
Binariang signed in November 1991 a non-binding memorandum of  understanding with Arianespace and Hughes Communications International Inc  respectively for the launch and manufacture of the satellite.
But latest reports said US-based McDonnell Douglas was also making a  determined effort to get the launch contract.

The Gdansk shipyards (Stocznia Gdanska) are to  built two steamships for a Greek shipping firm worth a total of 250 million  dollars, a shipyard spokesman said.
He said they would be "the first steamships ever built in Poland",
180 meters long and 27.2 meters wide. Each will be able to take 950  passengers in 400 cabins, while there will be a crew of 170.
The contract calls for the first ship to be ready at the end of 1996, and  the second six months later.
Stocznia Gdanska employs 9,000 people and had sales last year of 135  million dollars.

The search for an opposition Labour Party leader to  replace John Smith promises to be long and complex, due in part to democratic  reforms pushed through by Smith himself last year, observers said Friday.
Smith, whose political acumen and common touch had positioned him as the  man most likely to become Britain's first Labour prime minister in 15 years,  died suddenly of a heart attack Thursday at 55.
By a swift stroke of destiny, the party that seemed on the brink of  sweeping away a faltering Conservative Party suddenly found itself with a  jagged leadership void.
Smith's funeral was expected to be held in his native Scotland next week.
His deputy, Margaret Beckett, 51, who took over the interim reins, was  only one of several lining up to succeed the dynamic and acerbic-tongued  Smith, being termed by many Friday as "the best prime minister Britain never  had."
Two top contenders emerging were Labour shadow home secretary Tony Blair,  41, and shadow chancellor Gordon Brown, 43, both from the party's right, both  described as "modernisers," both Smith's loyal lieutenants.
Shadow industry spokesman Robin Cook, 48, was also being mentioned, as was  transport spokesman John Prescott, 55, the tough-talking former merchant  seaman credited with helping Smith ram through his controversial "one  member-one vote" reforms at the party conference last year.
Those reforms, which effectively wrested control of the party from the  powerful unions that created it as their mouthpiece early in the century, were  Smith's democratic legacy in broadening the base for choosing party leadership.
They also promised to extend and complicate the selection process.
Under the old block voting system, union officials would vote on their  members' behalf, automatically controlling 40 percent of the total vote, with  30 percent going to party members and 30 percent to party MPs.
Under Smith's reforms, votes in Labour's new electoral college will now be  apportioned three ways: one-third to the party's 264 MPs and 45 Euro-MPs,  one-third to the party's 250,000 dues-paying members, and one-third to some  4.5 million union members each of whom is now entitled to a secret ballot.
Observers said voting under the new system could take up to six weeks, and  that party's National Executive Committee (NEC) was unlikely even to begin the  process until after next month's European Parliament elections.
Candidates to succeed Smith would need the support of at least 12.5  percent of the Parliamentary Labour Party for their names to go on the ballot.
The NEC will also decide whether to hold a special conference to announce  the result, as happened in July 1992 when Smith was elected to replace Neil  Kinnock.
It could decide not to unveil them until the annual Labour Party  conference in Blackpool in October, observers said.
That prospect was said to be worrying several Labour leaders anxious for  the succession to be completed as quickly as possible.
They see a leadership void extended through the summer as threatening to  neutralize the momentum the party gathered in last week's local council  elections, which gave the governing Tories their worst defeat ever.
In the most recent opinion polls before Smith's death, Labour enjoyed a  commanding 50 percent lead among those asked who they would vote for in a  general election, against less than 30 percent for the Conservatives.

A previously unknown movement calling itself  Anti-Fascist Action said it had set fire to a central Athens cinema overnight  in protest at neo-Nazis, Greek police reported here on Friday.
The l00 or so people in the cinema escaped unhurt.
A phonecaller to a radio station claimed the attack as a protest against  the cinema owner who hired it out several months ago the Greek neo-Nazi  movement Chryssi Avghi for a meeting.

Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed IRA,  has made what Irish government sources said Friday was a "genuine attempt" to  break the deadlocked peace process by seeking clarification on certain points  in the landmark Anglo-Irish declaration.
The sources, quoted by the Irish Times of Dublin, said Sinn Fein had sent  a document to the Irish government outlining the points it felt needed further  explanation.
Another source quoted by the Times described the document as "substantial"  and said it would be transmitted immediately to London.
Since the Anglo-Irish document was signed, Sinn Fein, which is led by  Gerry Adams, has asked London for "clarifications" before giving any answer to  conditions set down in the declaration.
But London and Dublin have both criticized Sinn Fein's queries up to now  as being too vague.
The declaration was signed by Britain and Ireland to try to end 25 years  of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
It broke ground with an offer from Britian to bring Sinn Fein into  negotiations on Northern Ireland's future provided the Irish Republican Army  fighters observed a total three-month ceasefire.
On Thursday night before he left for a visit to the United States, Irish  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he had hoped for a positive development to  end the impasse over the declaration.

Wendlinger's team, Sauber-Mercedes, decided in Monaco on Friday that their  second driver, Germany's Heinz-Harald Frentzen, would not start Sunday's race  as a mark of his respect.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin met here Friday with  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss cooperation between Moscow and  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
Yeltsin, on the last day of his three-day visit to Germany, then headed to  Stuttgart to meet with a group of businessmen.
Earlier, Kinkel said he was looking forward to his meeting with Yeltsin to  discuss cooperation with the NATO alliance and the Partnership for Peace  Agreement.
"It is an important issue for the Russians and for us as well," Kinkel  said.
Russian membership in the NATO partnership program recently ran into snags  after NATO carried out air strikes in Bosnia last month without consulting  Moscow.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said recently that the current  partnership program was not "agreeable to Russia" and added that Moscow would  soon be presenting an alternative plan.
The partnership programs offer former Warsaw Pact countries closer  military cooperation with the alliance but stop short of giving them full  membership.
"The meetings in Bonn have provided an opportunity to go forward with this  question," Dieter Vogel, a German government spokesman, said Friday, adding  that Yeltsin's visit here was positive overall.
Yeltsin was to head back to Moscow later in the afternoon.

Tajik government and opposition leaders are to met  here in June to resume UN-sponsored talks to resolve the crisis in Tajikistan,  Iranian officials said Friday.
A first round of talks between the democratic and Islamic opposition and  the pro-communist government was held in Moscow in March, after the  assassination of Deputy Prime Minister Mouzabcho Nazarchoiev, but without  progress.
However, a leading member of the the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan (IMT),  Akbar Turjanzadeh, predicted earlier this week that the two sides could reach  a settlement in Tehran, according to the Iranian news agency IRNA.
A special UN envoy on Tajikistan, Pierre Baben, met Thursday with Iran's  deputy foreign minister Mahmud Vaezi, who confirmed that Iran, Russia,  Afghanistan and Pakistan would attend as observers.
Vaezi said Tehran favored a "peaceful solution to the crisis" through the  formation of a "national reconciliation government," official Iranian sources  said.
Baben thanked Iran for its "constructive efforts" in helping bring peace  to Tajikistan, the sources added.
Tajik opposition groups agreed to hold direct talks with the Dushanbe  government after Iran and Russia offered to mediate.
Neo-communists took power in Dushanbe in December 1992, unseating the  ruling coalition of democratic and Islamic forces.
The Tajik opposition is currently made up of the IMT, the Democratic Party  of Tajikistan, the Popular Resurrection Movement and the Popular Movement of  Badakhshan.

The Ferranti defence business has been sold to  GEC-Marconi, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary of British group General Electric  Co. (GEC), Ferranti receivers announced here on Friday.
The receivers, from Arthur Andersen chartered accountants, did not  indicate the value of the deal, which becomes effective Thursday evening.  According to the British press, the amount should be around 50 million pounds.
GEC is taking over Ferranti Defence Systems Integration (FDSI) and  Ferranti Simulation and Training (FS and T), which employ 1,110 people between  them.
The receivers said the deal opens the way to finalization in the next few  weeks of negotiations concerning Ferranti satellite communications and  civilian and industrial activities.
At the end of March, the receivers designated GEC as the favored candidate  for acquisition of the main Ferranti defence activities and said an  agreement-in-principle had been reached on the matter. They said separate  negotiations on other Ferranti activities would continue with other interested  companies.
Ferranti Group started sliding into slow bankruptcy four years ago with  the discovery of a large-scale fraud involving fake contracts at its US  subsidiary, International Signal and Control (ISC), bought in 1987.

US consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in April,  the Commerce Department said Friday.
Most experts forecast a 0.3 percent advance in the department's Consumer  Price Index.
The government announced Thursday that wholesale prices in April fell 0.1  percent, surprising experts who predicted a 0.2 percent increase.

Danish Interior and Immigration Minister Birte  Weiss said Friday she asked Albania, Hungary and Slovenia for authorisation to  set up Danish-run camps for refugees from former Yugoslavia on their  territories.
In a note to parliament, Weiss said there was no agreement so far to the  requests, made in April, but that the government was continuing to seek an  accord with the three countries.
Denmark runs a refugee camp in Bosnia-Hercegovina amd another in Croatia  but the Croatian authorities last month refused to allow Denmark to set up  another one there.
Denmark has also offered shelter for some 18,000 refugees from  ex-Yugoslavia but believes haven should be provided as close as possible to  home to facilitate return and to cut government spending.

Two men, both English, were convicted Friday and  jailed for 30 years each for their part in an Irish Republican Army (IRA)  bombing campaign that included last year's huge blast at Harrod's department  store in central London.
"You are both evil men whose business is terror, death and destruction,"  Judge Anthony Hidden told former army corporal Jan Taylor, 51, and computer  expert Patrick Hayes, 41.
Both men were convicted of the explosion in a litter bin outside Harrod's  in January last year, in which four people were injured, and a blast on a  train the following month, which led to massive damage.
They had been caught in the act of placing the Harrod's and other bombs by  security video cameras.
Both were also convicted of possession of semtex and other explosives and  firearms.
Hayes was additionally found guilty of plotting to cause explosions at  Canary Wharf, Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park Tube station, all in  London, in 1992.
Both men smirked and nudged one another as the judge told them, "It is  only by the greatest good fortune no lives were lost.
"You both go about the business of terrorism with no thought for the lives  and limbs of members of the public and no concern for the massive destruction  you set out to unleash and the terror you seek to instill," he said.
Hayes and Taylor left the dock waving clenched fists and shouting, "Up the  IRA" (Republican Army) and a Gaelic slogan meaning, "Our time will come."

Striking sailing staff of the SNCM shipping  company decided to resume work on Friday after a court ordered suspension of  their strike earlier in the day, company management announced.
The announcement said the first ferries for Corsica would sail in the  evening.
Traffic will resume "as soon as loading and sailing preparations have been  completed, whatever the number of passengers may be", it said.
The conflict related to staffing and working conditions.

Bavarian and Italian police have  arrested two Sicilian Mafia suspects for smuggling forged Italian banknotes  worth one million marks ( 606,000 dollars) into southern Germany, police here  reported Friday.
A wine merchant here, identified only as Luigi P., 48, was picked up this  week, and in Sicily police held Paolo Lo lacono, 35, in his home village  Partinicio.
Lacono's father Francesco, 59, a senior "godfather" who spent six years in  Germany, has been in prison in Palermo for the past year awaiting trial for  the murder of four rival clan members whose bodies were dissolved in acid.

Kawasaki Steel Corp., the only big Japanese  steelmaker not to curtail capital spending this year, announced Friday plans  to streamline its steel activities while cutting its number of board members  by six.
The company said it would realign its four steel divisions into a  production and development division and a sales and planning division from  July.
The board will be reduced from 34 to 28 by eliminating the posts of vice  chairman, cutting the number of vice presidents and senior managing directors  from three to two and lowering the number of other directors from 15 to 12.
Kawasaki Steel, which along with other Japanese steelmakers has been  crippled by the strong yen, has forecast a pre-tax loss of 32 billion yen (310  million dollars) for the year to last March.
While its rivals announced plans last month to slash capital investment  this year, Kawasaki said spending would rise from 135 billion yen to 170  billion yen because of existing commitments under a five-year plan to  modernise a mill.

Ajello
MAPUTO, May 13 (AFP) - The head of the United Nations mission in  Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, said Friday he was dissatisfied with virtually all  aspects of the peace process ahead of October elections after 16 years of  civil war.
"There is no progress with assembly of troops, we've wasted time with  demobilisation and we still have serious problems with forming a new national  army," Ajello said.
He said he was calling a meeting of Mozambique's main peacekeeping  committee next week to discuss these problems and the UN's latest resolution,  which is to reduce its Mozambican peacekeeping mission (ONUMOZ) by 2,000  soldiers immediately and terminate the mandate completely on November 15.
The government called a halt to demobilisation of its forces three weeks  ago, claiming the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) opposition was not  keeping pace with the process.
"Unfortunately, by the time they made that announcement, RENAMO was  already catching up," Ajello said.
He added that the government apparently needed time to correct its lists  of soldiers, as some names were marked down both for demobilisation and for  joining the new national army.
ONUMOZ now has names of 2,459 RENAMO fighters from the 4,000 due to be  demobilised, against 17,593 names from the government.
The government was originally expected to discharge 62,00 soldiers but now  claims it only has some 50,00 soldiers to demobilise.
Ajello dismissed government claims that ONUMOZ "misunderstood" the number  of soldiers it presented, saying: "There was no confusion nor any  misunderstanding on our side.
"Anyone can make a mistake including the government, the only thing to do  is admit and correct it".
He added that he would accept the new government figures, despite RENAMO's  suspicion that the government was hiding troops instead of demobilising them.
Western diplomats in Maputo suggest some government army officials  deliberately inflated the numbers of soldiers in order to draw salaries and  attract donations on behalf of men who were no longer in the army.

A Palestinian stabbed a Jewish settler on Friday  near Tapuah settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, military officials  said.
The army launched a manhunt after the Palestinian fled. The settler was  taken to hospital for treatment but he was not in danger.
Earlier Friday, Palestinian police took control of the West Bank town of  Jericho ending 27 years of Israeli occupation, under the May 4 deal to launch  Palestinian self-rule.

Formula One drivers joined together to form a  pressure group here on Friday in a bid to improve safety in a sport now  overshadowed by death and injury.
The move follows Thursday's crash here which left Austrian driver Karl  Wendlinger fighting for his life, and the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Drivers met for four hours on Friday, deciding a plan of action --  primarily to call for circuit safety inspections at the next three races --  and electing four men to represent them.
The main concern was to get their safety concerns across to the ruling  International Automobile Federation (FIA) and its British president, Max  Mosley.
Austria's former world champion Niki Lauda announced after the session at  the Automobile Club de Monaco, that: "We agreed to form a Grand Prix Drivers  Association.
"It was agreed that the representatives of the association would be Niki  Lauda, Michael Schumacher, Gerhard Berger and Christian Fittipaldi.
"The GPDA requests representation on or with the FIA to improve the safety  of Formula One."
He said the association was concerned about "the immediate situation" and  wanted "to look at the next three Grand Prix circuits together with the FIA  for possible improvements."
All the current world championship drivers were at the meeting, along with  three currently without a team -- Britain's Derek Warwick, Frenchman Patrick  Tambay and Italian Riccardo Patrese.
A GPDA had been set up during the 1970s, but petered out in the early  1980s. Drivers have been without any formal representation within the FIA for  several years.

Hearts manager Sandy Clark has reacted furiously to  suggestions the Edinburgh club will play out a tame draw at Partick Thistle on  Saturday that would guarantee both clubs Premier Division football next season.
In theory either club could go down if Kilmarnock take at least a point at  Hibernian and relegation favourites St Johnstone upset the odds by scoring a  big win at Motherwell.
Hearts and Thistle sit a point clear of Kilmarnock, who are in turn a  point ahead of Saints in the third relegation place above the already doomed  Raith Rovers and Dundee.
Clark said: "I am sure Thistle will think the same as me that we are too  professional to look for a draw and, besides, one of the best ways of ensuring  at least a draw is to go for a win."
Saints manager Paul Sturrock admits his six months in Perth have been  traumatic but the former Scotland international is still looking forward to  the Saturday showdown.
He said: "We have been written off five or six times already this season  and dug ourselves back into contention.
"We have to be positive and go for a win because the worst thing to happen  would be for Hibs to beat Kilmarnock but we lose at Motherwell."
Killie too have to look after their own interests first without worrying  about others.
"What we are looking for is one last big effort from the players,"  admitted assistant manager Billy Stark.
"Hibs might have lost 4-0 to Dundee last week but professional pride will  ensure this is a tough game."
With Rangers already champions, Falkirk are in pole position to win the  first division title and promotion ahead of Dunfermline. Victory at Clydebank  would clinch it.
"We don't have to lift the players this week, rather it's a case of  calming them down," said Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies.

Liberia's biggest armed faction, Charles Taylor's  NPFL, Friday ruled out peace talks with its Liberian Peace Council (LPC) foes,  contradicting an earlier LPC report that the two enemies planned negotiations.
"We are not aware of any meeting with the LPC," said NPFL spokesman John  Richardson.
The talks had been announced last week by the transition government's  information minister Joe Mulbah, a former NPFL spokesman.
But Richardson said that holding talks with the LPC, which the NPFL has  been fighting for supremacy along the Atlantic coast and the border with Ivory  Coast, "would be tantamount to recognizing it as a faction.
"That could encourage others to go into the bush and take up arms."
The LPC was set up in September 1993 but at the time did not sign on to a  peace accord reached two months earlier between the NPFL, the United  Liberation Movement for Liberation (ULIMO), and the former interim government.
The accord was aimed at ending a civil war that killed some 150,000 since  December 1989.
But disarming all the warring factions has proven difficult due to  continued clashes between the NPFL and the Peace Council as well as various  other ethnic clans.
Richardson said Friday that the NPFL had ceased to disarm its toops "due  to the inability of the the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, to stop  the fighting between the NPFL and LPC, as well as the tribal fighting between  elements in ULIMO."
He added that the "NPFL is presently maintaining a defensive position to  stop all aggressions from those who want to hijack the peace process."

A treaty of asociation between Russia and the  European Union will be at the top of Germany's agenda during its forthcoming  presidency of the EU, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told visiting Russian  President Boris Yeltsin on Friday.
Yeltsin, on the last day of a three-day visit to Germany, met Kinkel to  discuss cooperation between Moscow and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  The Russian leader then headed to Stuttgart to meet businessmen.
Kinkel said in a statement released after their talks that he had pledged  Bonn would make the treaty "one of the top priorities of the German presidency  of the Union."
Bonn takes over the six-month rotating presidency from Greece on July 1.
The statement added that much of the meeting centered on new European  security arrangements.
Kinkel expressed hopes Russia would soon play an active role in European  security policy by joining the NATO-proposed Partnership for Peace programme.
"President Yelstin stressed Russia had no difficulty (with the accord) and  would sign soon," the statement said. "But Russia wishes to set out in a  protocol the specific content of the cooperation between NATO and Russia."
Kinkel, echoing an earlier pledge by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also  reassured Yeltsin that Germany would back Russian efforts to obtain full  membership of the GATT world trade accord and of the G7 group of most  industrialised countries.
Earlier, Kinkel said he was looking forward to the talks with Yeltsin.
"It is an important issue for the Russians and for us as well," Kinkel  said.
Russian membership in the NATO partnership programme recently ran into  snags after NATO carried out air strikes in Bosnia last month without  consulting Moscow.
Kozyrev said recently that the current partnership programme was not  "agreeable to Russia" and added that Moscow would soon be presenting an  alternative plan.
The proposed partnership offers former Warsaw Pact countries closer  military cooperation with the alliance but stops short of giving them full  membership.
"The meetings in Bonn have provided an opportunity to move forward on this  question," said German government spokesman Dieter Vogel Friday, adding that  Yeltsin's visit here was positive overall.
Yeltsin was to head back to Moscow later in the afternoon.

Israeli intelligence chief
JERUSALEM, May 13 (AFP) - The PLO will need support if the peace process  is to succeed, the head of Israeli military intelligence Uri Saguy said in an  interview published Friday.
Saguy told the right-wing daily Maariv that "backing the PLO is a  necessary condition for the success of the peace process."
He warned that radical and Moslem fundamentalist groups opposed to the  peace process were likely to step up their attacks on Jerusalem and the West  Bank, as well as "inside Israeli territory."
But in the newly autonomous Gaza Strip, "terrorist attacks will go down or  at least will come up against PLO opposition."
He warned however that supporting the Palestine Liberation Organisation  could "whet the appetite of this organisation and its demands for the creation  of a Palestinian state."

FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter urged  Japan on Friday to ease tough anti-drug immigration rules and grant  Argentinian soccer captain Diego Maradona a visa, describing the convicted  drug-user as "a victim not a culprit."
Maradona and his Argentinian teammates are set to pull out of the Kirin  Cup tournament after Tokyo stuck by it's stringent policy of denying visas to  individuals like Maradona convicted of narcotics offences.
"It is my personal opinion that it is unfair for a government to continue  to punish any person who has been convicted of such an offence but has served  his punishment," said Blatter, who is visiting the Asian Football  Confederation Congress being held in Malaysia.
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in April 1991 for concaine  possession and five months later was given a 14 month suspended sentence by an  Italian court on the same charge.
Blatter said neither Japanese nor Argentinian soccer officials had raised  the controversy with him and the first he heard of it was when a journalist  raised the issue at a press conference.
"It does not directly involve FIFA because it is a friendly tournament  afterall. If they contacted us we would simply offer them this advice," said  Blatter.
Blatter also pleaded for a little understanding of Maradona's  cirumstances, which he said made him more likely to be arrested than anybody  else.
"I ask you this, if he were not a footballer would there have been a  problem because he most likely would not have been caught? "said Blatter.
Meanwhile Blatter told a press conference it was likely that FIFA's  executive committee meeting next Friday would agree to raise the World Cup  format to 32 teams in time for the 1998 competition, an increase of eight  sides.
But Blatter said the extra places would be shared between the regional  confederations and would be decided "after knowing the results of the  performances of the regions in the 1994 World Cup."

Delegates at the Asian Football Confederation  congress dealt a humiliatig blow to Japan's high-profile 2002 World Cup bid  Friday, when they rejected the country's top official Tadao Murata in two  high-profile elections.
Murata, secretary general of Japan's 2002 bidding committee, polled only  two out of 32 votes in the bitter battle for FIFA's vice-presidency which was  won by his arch-rival South Korean Chung Moon-Jung with 11 votes.
Murata, who used English soccer legend Bobby Charlton and free bottles of  12-year-old malt whisky as campaign tools, was further stunned when he again  came last in polling for his old seat as one of the AFC's four vice-presidents.
"I learned a lot of things today," said Murata after a roller-coaster day  of elections which saw only one incumbent AFC official out of six secure  re-election.
Murata's defeat means Japan, one of Asia's soccer powerhouses after the  launch of the popular J-League last year, has no senior official in the AFC  for the first time since Murata first became AFC vice-president in 1964.
Commenting on a dramatic day in which 36 candidates were jostling for 17  elected positions, FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter said, "I just felt it  from the very moment I arrived here that this was going to be an exciting  election.
There was a measure of good news for both Japan and South Korea's World  Cup campaigns when Blatter told a press conference on Friday that FIFA  definetely wanted to stage the 2002 World Cup in Asia.

The Chinese government has released five more  religious dissidents in its latest gesture of human rights concessions to the  US in the run-up to a renewal of its most favoured nation (MFN) trade status.
Three members of the Protestant Church of the New Testament, Chen Zhuman,  Yan Peizhi and Xu Zhihe, along with Roman Catholic priests Zhang Li and Chu  Tai, were recently released early from reeducation camps for good behaviour,  the official Xinhua news agency said Friday.
The five had been given sentences of between one and three years in labour  camps from 1992-93 for having "disturbed public order and endangered public  security by their religious activities."
Chen Zhuman, 50, was sentenced in Fujian, in July 1992, to three years in  a reeducation camp for having illegally rejoined a group of the Church of the  New Testament.
Yan Peizhei, 35, and Xu Zhihe, 50, both peasants from Shandong, also  belonged to the Protestant organization when they were sentenced to three  years in labour camp in December 1992.
Zhang Li and Chu Tai, both Catholic priests from Zhangjiakou in Hebei  province, were sentenced to three years and one year, respectively, in  November 1993.
When the communist government came to power in 1949 after a civil war, it  created several officially sanctioned churches and suppressed the activities  of Christians who refused to join -- especially Catholics who remained loyal  to the Vatican.
On Thursday, Chinese authorities announced the release on parole of  another Christian dissident, Zhang Ruiyu, who had been sentenced to four years  in prison in 1991.
"The Chinese authorities are trying to charm (US President Bill) Clinton  by adeptly playing on religion and swaying American public opinion," a western  diplomat here said.
Clinton must decide by June 3 whether or not to renew China's privileged  MFN trading status which allows Chinese products easier access to US markets.  Washington however has made the improvement of the human rights situation in  China a precondition to MFN renewal.
International human rights organizations have rallied for the release of  the six religious dissidents on several occasions.
Observers here said it was less dangerous for Beijing to release the  religious dissidents than more militant political dissidents who could stir up  more trouble ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre  on June 4.
Authorities over the past few weeks have rounded up at least six active  political dissidents here and in the eastern city of Shanghai.
The latest arrest was that of Shanghai-based dissident Yang Zhou on  Thursday. Zhou is a spokesman for the Chinese Association for Human Rights.
China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, is meanwhile kept under  police guard at a state residence in a Beijing suburb.
President Jiang Zemin, who is also head of the Chinese Communist Party, on  Thursday for the first time publicly defended the bloody suppression of the  1989 pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square, saying authorities were  determined to use all methods available to avoid another such incident.
Chinese leaders are also employing another tactic to convince the United  States to renew MFN -- allowing a few dissidents to leave the country.
In April, 1989 pro-democracy movement leader Wang Juntao was given  permission to leave in order to seek medical treatment in the United States.
Wang had been sentenced to 13 years imprisonment, receiving the harshest  penalty given to any leader connected to the movement.
Dissident intellectual Yu Haocheng early this week received the green  light from authorities to visit the United States to teach at New York's  Columbia University, after several years of trying to secure permission.
But most observers here believe the release of dissidents is aimed solely  at guaranteeing the continuation of MFN.

Indian company Gujarat Torrent Energy  Corp. (GTEC, in Ahmedabad) has chosen a consortium led by Siemens Group to  build a turnkey power-station, the German group announced here on Friday.
The plant at Paguthan, in Gujarat State, will have a power rating of 655  MGW and will be able to operate on natural gas or light oil. The investment  amounts to 1.3 billion German marks, 800 million of which goes to Siemens, the  announcement said.
Siemens has also acquired a holding in GTEC, the partners in which are  private group Torrent and government-owned Gujarat Power Corp.
Siemens said a contract had been signed on Thursday in Ahmedabad, capital  of Gujarat, by Indian electricity minister N.K.P. Salve and regional industry  minister Chandrikaben Chudasama.
The new plant will play a key role in industrializing Gujarat State, the  announcement said. It will be the first private power-station in the state  since the electricity sector was opened to private investment. The electricity  produced will be bought by Gujarat Electricity Board.
The facility is to start production in 24 months and be fully operational  in three years.

Suspected Islamic militants shot dead three  policemen and wounded a fourth on Friday in the Asyut region, a fundamentalist  stronghold in southern Egypt, the interior ministry said.
The assailants sprayed automatic weapons fire at conscripts guarding a  police station in Badari, near Abu Tig, 400 kilometers (240 miles) south of  Cairo, killing two and wounding one.
A few hours later, Sergeant Abdel Mohsen Eteifi Nasser was shot dead as he  stepped out of his home in Abu Tig, and his machine-gun was stolen.
Both attacks were carried out by the same group, which managed to escape,  sources close to the security services said.
The latest killings bring to 138 the number of policemen murdered since  Islamic militants launched a campaign to topple President Hosni Mubarak two  years ago. The campaign has also cost the lives of 144 militants.
Almost two-thirds of the police victims died in the Asyut region, a  stronghold of the main militant group, Jamaa Islamiya.

Two Saudis convicted of rape and a Pakistani  drug-smuggler were beheaded by sword Friday in Saudi Arabia, the interior  ministry said in a statement broadcast on television.
Saudis Saleh Selimi and Kasseb Zahrani were sentenced to death for raping  a woman at knife point after breaking into her house. They were beheaded in  Jeddah, on the western coast.
Pakistani Hakam Khan Said Ismail Khan, who had attempted to smuggle heroin  into the kingdom, was executed in the capital Riyadh.
Twelve people have now been beheaded in Saudia Arabia this year, according  to figures compiled from interior ministry statements.
Saudi Arabia decided in 1987 to sentence to death drug traffickers,  pushers and persistent users in a bid to stop drug abuse.
Beheadings are usually performed publicly, after the weekly collective  prayer on Fridays.

The Indian government will not privatise the two  state-owned airlines, Air India and Indian Airlines, until their services  improve, federal civil aviation secretary K. Padmanabhiah said here Friday.
He said the government had delayed plans to sell a part of its 100 percent  stake in both airlines and float a Euroissue to raise funds for ambitious  expansion plans.
"The privatisation will not proceed till we improve the quality of our  product," Padmanabhiah, who is also chairman of both airlines, said.
"Most of the year we are handling labour problems instead of improving the  quality of the service. This must end, and the employees must see the writing  in the skies," he said, referring to increased competition by private airlines  on the domestic sector.
Padmanabhiah revealed that Air India had carried 2.2 million passengers in  1992-93 against 2.1 million in 1987-88.
"There is no appreciable growth as the number of seats and schedules had  not gone up," he said, adding that the airlines planned to buy five more  aircraft as part of their expansion plans.
Padmanabhiah also unveiled Friday a frequent-flier program by both  airlines for passengers flying to overseas destinations.
The program called "flying returns" will be launched on June 1 and will  initialy be limited to Indian residents, he said.
He said the two airlines will also shortly operate a world-wide advanced  reservation system to attract more passengers.
Air India is the single largest airline operating out of India. Indian  Airlines, until recently the monopoly domestic carrier, also operates  international flights.

China has indicated its readiness to consider  possible voluntary export restraints to curb the explosive growth in Chinese  textile exports to Japan, government sources were quoted as saying Friday.
The evening edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted international trade  and industry sources as saying that Chinese trade officials had informed the  ministry they were "studying" introducion of export controls.
The newspaper said the Chinese move was aimed at discouraging Japan from  restricting imports of textiles from China under the 1974 multilateral fibre  arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
But it also noted that a bilateral deal to "voluntarily" restrict the flow  of textile trade between the two countries could attract international  criticism of Japan while damaging China's bid to join GATT.
The ministry refused to confirm the report, but confirmed that Yukio Doi,  director general of its consumer goods industries bureau, was scheduled to  visit Beijing from May 23 for "regular" talks with Chinese trade officials.
Japan's imports of Chinese textile soared 31 percent to almost eight  billion dollars in the year to March, accounting for almost half of the  overall 24 percent jump in imports from the country to 21.7 billion dollars.

The dollar firmed against other major currencies  in quiet trading here early Friday after the government reported an  unexpectedly small rise in April consumer prices and because of a long holiday  weekend in Europe.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 381 dollars an ounce, up 1.10 dollars from late  Thursday.
The dollar jumped to 1.6730 German marks just after the announcement that  consumer prices rose a modest 0.1 percent in April, much lower than the 0.3  percent advance many analysts had expected, and then fell back slightly.
At about 9:45 a.m. (1250 GMT), the greenback traded at 1.6705 German  marks, up from 1.6675 late Thursday. It stood at 1.6730 marks an hour earlier  in London.
Against the yen, the dollar stood at 104.85, up from 104.22 late Thursday.  In London, it had climbed to 105.35 yen after the announcement that  US-Japanese trade talks would resume in Washington next week.
The US currency also firmed against other major European currencies,  rising to 5.7288 French francs from 5.7200 late Thursday, to 1.4277 Swiss  francs (1.4245) and to 0.6673 pound sterling (0.6669).
A trader with a major European bank in New York predicted the dollar would  move between 1.6650 and 1.6750 marks for the rest of the day.
Traders were cautiously awaiting the Federal Reserve's next meeting of its  policy-setting Open Market Committee, on Tuesday. Analysts expect the Fed will  raise the federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight interbank  loans.

An official Japanese task force studying measures to  give greater market access to foreign products and services has listed 21  areas for deregulation, officials said Friday.
The proposals were made by the Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman  (OTO) in a report submitted Friday to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.
The report proposed that Japanese regulations and testing procedures on  imports of foods and industrial products, including construction materials,  should be relaxed.
Japan is to announce market-opening measures before the end of June under  pressure from foreign countries, particularly the United Statets which suffers  chronic huge trade deficits with Japan.
Hata was quoted as saying at a meeting of economic ministers Friday that  each ministry and government agency should make efforts for economic  deregulation.
Those attending the meeting included Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa.

Taiwan's entry in the official competition  at the Cannes Film Festival tells a story of cultural confusion in Asia, but  which will be appreciated worldwide, its director told AFP Friday.
Edward Yang, speaking an hour before the premiere of "A Confucian  Confusion" here, said the film was about a specific culture, but has far wider  resonances.
"I don't think its referring just to Taiwan, its referring to Hong Kong,  Korea, Japan and Singapore, all the confucian-influenced societies," he said  in an interview with AFP.
And he added: "If I've done a good job to tell a human story, then people  from other parts of the world will appreciate it ... I wouldn't be surprised  at it because were all human."
"That's why drama is so interesting because its about humanity not just  because were Chinese or French or British. It's a document to look back on in  the future," he said.
The movie, starring new faces Chen Xianqi, Ni Shujun and Wang Weiming,  tells the story of a group of 12 former schoolfriends living hectic  professional and romantic lives in Taipei.
The relentlessly urban setting -- much of the action is set in cars  driving from one apartment to another in downtown Taipei -- contrasts with key  artist characters who turn against the modern technological environment.
Yang says the polarity of the setting and characters relects the cultural  confusion felt by young people not only in Taiwan, but also other Asian  democracies.
"There's a dilemma whether you want to do more about your life or whether  you want to accept the intimidating pressure which puts you back in your  place," he said.
"This is basically what all these societies ... not the ones that are  still developing, but the ones that are already developed, like Taiwan, Hong  Kong, Japan, Korea .. pretty soon China is going to be in that position. This  is what is happening in Asia.
"The West hasn't really realized this culture change. Every one of these  states is trying to implement democracy," he added.
Yang, 47, is in the official competition on the Croisette for the first  time after an appearance in the Un Certain Regard section of the festival in  1987.
But he insists he is not intimidated by seeing his film premiered on the  first full day of the 47th Cannes International Film Festival -- the world's  biggest filmfest.
Above all he has no expectations of winning the top prize, the Golden  Palm, he says, admitting that he has not seen last year's Chinese winner, Chen  Kaige's "Farewell To My Concubine."
Asked how he rates his chances, he replies simply: "I don't. I'd be stupid  if I did. There's nothing I can do now. I've done my best to make the film.  I'm happy about it."
And is he nervous ahead of the public premiere? "No. After five years in  this business you know whats going on. There is nothing you can do about it  ... its not a big deal at all," he says.

Malaysia's national car-maker and Japan's  Mitsubishi group have obtained approval to set up a joint company with a  Vietnamese firm to assemble and sell automobiles in Vietnam, officials said  Friday.
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) and its partners, Mitsubishi  Corporation and Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, are to join forces with  Vietranscimex to establish the Vina Star Motor Corporation, Proton said in a  statement.
The four parties are each to hold 25 percent stakes in Vina Star, which is  to assemble the Delica minibus before it begins assembly of Proton cars later,  Proton said.
Vina Star, which involves a total investment of 50 million US dollars, is  expected to start operations by March next year in Ho Chi Minh City, Proton  said.
It will initially produce 1,000 units of the Delica, and a year later will  raise output to reach 12,000 units a year, it said.
"The investment licence was approved by the Vietnamese State Committee for  Cooperation and Investment in April. Registration procedures are expected to  be completed by this month," a spokesman for Proton said.
Vina Star is to be capitalised at 12 million US dollars, which will later  be raised to 16 million dollars.
Proton, listed on the local bourse, would source its contribution of four  million US dollars for the venture through its internally generated cash  resources, the company said.
Mitsubishi Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Corp hold 17 percent equity in  Malaysia's nine-year-old national car venture, a brainchild of Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad.

Ajello
MAPUTO, May 13 (AFP) - The head of the UN mission in Mozambique, Aldo  Ajello, gave a heavily critical assessment Friday of the peace process here  ahead of October elections, the first slated after 16 years of civil war.
Ajello said he was dissatisfied with virtually all aspects of the peace  process, attacked delays in demobilisation and warned organisational problems  which had hit South Africa's recent poll boded ill for underdeveloped  Mozambique.
"There is no progress with assembly of troops, we've wasted time with  demobilisation and we still have serious problems with forming a new national  army," Ajello said.
He said he was calling a meeting of Mozambique's main peacekeeping  committee next week to discuss these problems and the UN's latest resolution,  which is to reduce its Mozambican peacekeeping mission (ONUMOZ) by 2,000  soldiers immediately and terminate the mandate completely on November 15.
The government called a halt to demobilisation of its forces three weeks  ago, claiming the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) opposition was not  keeping pace with the process.
"Unfortunately, by the time they made that announcement, RENAMO was  already catching up," Ajello said.
He added that the government apparently needed time to correct its lists  of soldiers, as some names were marked down both for demobilisation and for  joining the new national army.
ONUMOZ now has names of 2,459 RENAMO fighters from the 4,000 due to be  demobilised, against 17,593 names from the government.
The government was originally expected to discharge 62,00 soldiers but now  claims it only had some 50,00 soldiers to demobilise.
Ajello dismissed government claims that ONUMOZ "misunderstood" the number  of soldiers it presented, saying: "There was no confusion nor any  misunderstanding on our side.
"Anyone can make a mistake including the government, the only thing to do  is admit and correct it."
He added that he would accept the new government figures, despite RENAMO's  suspicion that the government was hiding troops instead of demobilising them.
Ajello also made a public apology for the mistakes of the least succesful  aspect the ONUMOZ operation -- clearing landmines from the country.
"We've made an incredible bureaucratic mess," he said, admitting this had   delayed for more than 18 months the removal of hundreds of thousands of mines  planted during the war.
A key UN contract to clear some 2,000 kilometers of suspected mined road  has yet to be signed.
At least 200 people have suffered landmine injuries this year alone,  according to non-governmental organisations here.
Ajello suggested ONUMOZ made a mistake when it subjected mine-clearance  plans to approval from Mozambique's peace process committees - which failed to  function properly until a year after Mozambique's October 1992 peace accord -  and to a heavy-handed bureacracy in New York.
"This is a perfect story of how things should not be done," he said.
Ajello said the logistical mess and political goodwill surrounding South  Africa's elections offered vital lessons for Mozambique.
"Given South Africa's far better communications and technical capacity,  its grave logistical problems with organising elections are a very bad sign  for Mozambique."
However, he said, "the political will which helped overcome these problems  and the happy ending of the process in South Africa should be a lesson to all  of us here."

Share prices gained ground on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange this week, supported by active buying by overseas investors following  a continued fall in the Japanese yen.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues in the first section  increased 408.28 points or 2.1 percent this week to 20,270.75 points after  rising 137.22 points the previous week.
It was the first time since April 15 that the key indicator ended a week  above the psychologically important 20,000 mark.
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) of all issues in the  section rose 27.51 points to 1,643.20 following last week's 12.36 point rise.
First section turnover averaged 287.96 million shares up from 153.6  million shares traded last week. The average daily value of transactions  expanded from last week's 162.95 billion yen (1.6 billion dollars) to 279.15  billion yen.
After opening the week at 19,771.75 points, the Nikkei fell Monday as  investors failed to find fresh factors to stimultate the sluggish market  following last week's three-day national holiday.
But the key index rose for the rest of the week, as foreign investors, who  have been major players in the market during the year so far, actively joined  buying interest, brokers said.
They said most investors here weclomed the recent fall in the yen, which  would help export-oriented Japanese companies avoid unnecessary exchange  losses.
The dollar rose this week amid speculation that the United States was  acting together with Japan and European nations to save the US currency from  falling further.
The dollar, which almost fell below the 100 yen line two weeks ago, ended  here at 104.58 yen, up 1.48 yen from last week.
Brokers said investors were still waiting for earnings reports for the  year to March 31 to be issued in the coming weeks.
"The market is still in a good mood," a Tokyo-based broker said. "If  companies show better-than-expected profits in their annual reports, many  players, particularly corporate investors, will come back to the market  easily."
Car makers ended mixed this week. Toyota Motor remained unchanged at 1,980  yen, but Nissan Motor gained 16 yen to 875 yen. Honda Motor increased 60 yen  to 1,770 yen.
Many electronics makers gained ground on the depreciation of the yen. Sony  ended up 180 yen at 5,880 yen and Matsushita Electric Industrial rose 50 yen  to 1,710 yen. Sharp gained 40 yen to 1,700 yen.
Computer makers also enjoyed profits, with NEC rising 40 yen to 1,180 yen,  Fujitsu increasing 30 yen to 1,050 yen.

US consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in April,  the Labor Department said Friday.
Most experts forecasted a 0.3 percent advance in the department's Consumer  Price Index.
The government announced Thursday that wholesale prices in April fell 0.1  percent, surprising experts who predicted a 0.2 percent increase.
The moderate rise in consumer prices last month indicated inflation  remains well-controlled.
Excluding the food and energy categories, the index rose 0.2 pecent.
Consumer prices had climbed 0.3 percent in both February and March.
With the moderate rise in April, consumer prices for the year have climbed  at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. In 1993 the index rose 2.7 percent.
In April, energy prices fell 0.4 percent -- including 2.3 percent for fuel  oil -- while food prices rose 0.1 percent.
Fruit and vegetable prices dropped 2.3 percent.
Furniture prices remained unchanged, while clothing costs fell 0.3 percent.
Medical costs jumped 0.6 percent. Medical services were up 0.7 percent.

France launched its bid for the Cannes Film  Festival's top award Friday with the long-awaited "La Reine Margot," a lavish  historical drama billed as the most gripping film on the Croisette.
"What we are trying to do is grab the cinema audience and not to let them  go for a second," writer Daniele Thompson told AFP ahead of the premiere  Friday evening.
"It is a brutal film, like a thriller or a western. It is not a  sentimental film," he said, accurately describing the two and three-quarter  hour epic, full-blooded in more than one sense.
Starring Isabelle Adjani and Daniel Auteuil, the movie relates the gory  story of Marguerite of Valois, forced to marry for political expediency in  August 1572, in the heat of the French wars of religion.
From the opening frame the film pulls no punches in depicting the  brutality of the time, culminating in the Saint Bartholomew Day's Massacre of  August 23 and 24, when up to 100,000 protestants died.
Margot's sexual adventures -- her marriage puts no bars on these -- are  also included liberally in the mixture, a somewhat free interpretation of the  novel by Alexandre Dumas.
Thompson stresses that the role was written specifically for Adjani. "If  she had refused, I think we would not have had a film ... she is magnificent,"  he said.
The film, touted as France's best hope to try to regain the Golden Palm  for the first time in seven years, is premiered here Friday evening, at the  end of the first full day of the 47th Cannes International Film Festival.

Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Mussa will meet US  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Saturday in Geneva to discuss the  Middle East peace process, sources at the foreign ministry said.
Their talks would focus on the Israeli-Syrian track of the peace talks.
Christopher, in the Swiss city to attend a conference on Bosnia which  opened Friday, is to travel Sunday to Syria and the next day on to Israel, on  a peace shuttle.
Mussa, currently in London, was also to meet Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic in Geneva.

Former Italian premier Bettino Craxi, who has been  asked to surrender his passport to authorities, will appear before judges  investigating him for alleged corruption before the end of next week, his  attorney Enzo Lo Giudice said Friday.
"He will come back, you can rest assured he will come back before the end  of next week," Lo Giudice said about his client whose whereabouts are unknown.
He added that Craxi could be overseas but said he did not know where.
He said he spoke with him by telephone Thursday evening but Craxi did not  disclose his location.
The former socialist premier, who is under investigation in 20 separate  cases of alleged corruption, faces an international arrest warrant if he does  not appear soon before judges in Milan wishing to question him.
He was recently sighted on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris where he  owns an apartment. He also is a regular visitor to Hammamet in Tunisia where  his wife is officially resident.

US forces carried out a mock air,  land and sea invasion involving 44,000 soldiers this week, but US officials  denied a report it was a rehearsal for military intervention in Haiti.
The Boston Globe reported that the timing and tactics of the exercise,  code-named Agile Provider, were developed with Haiti in mind.
"Routine training, routine training," said White House press secretary Dee  Dee Myers. "As you know, these things take a while to schedule, and they  happen regularly. I wouldn't read too much into that."
A spokeswoman for the US Atlantic Command, Major Jamie Roach, confirmed  that a 16-day exercise involving 44,000 troops had ended Wednesday, but denied  it was staged with Haiti in mind and disputed other details of the report.
"Anything that happens in this hemisphere, whether it be a troop movement  or an exercise, people are trying to tie to reports of a Haiti invasion. It's  just not valid," said Roach.
Most of the troops were American, she said, but there were small  detachments of Dutch and Surinamese troops.
The Globe said the exercise used North Carolina and Puerto Rico as landing  sites for the mock invasion involving amphibious landing vessels, a submarine  and more than 200 sorties by Marine jet fighers.
Army Rangers landed 10 miles inland, seizing road junctions and knocking  out military communications, while special forces attacked command posts and  radio stations, according to the Globe.
The Globe, which cited unidentified military sources, said the exercise  was aimed at working out problems that arose during the 1983 invasion of  Grenada in coordinating different services.
A spokesman for the Atlantic command said the exercises had as a target a  fictitious country run by an "unfriendly leader" who had suddenly seized power.
But Roach said the attack scenario did not mention a Caribbean country.  "It was a Southwest Asia scenario," she said.
She said she was unaware that the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto  Rico took part in the exercise.
Most of it took place off the coast of North Carolina, but troops trained  near Savannah, Georgia and improved an airport on the Bahamian Island of Great  Inagua, she said.
President Bill Clinton warned last week that he did not rule out a  military intervention to restore democracy in Haiti, and the UN Security  Council gave the Haitian military leaders until May 21 to step down or face a  full commercial embargo.
The swearing-in of an interim president by the Haitian Senate Wednesday,  however, appears to confirm the military's determination to resist all  diplomatic pressure for their removal.
The US military option for Haiti has received mixed reviews abroad.  Visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that his government  would not participate in such a venture. The French diplomat, however,  reiterated his condemnation of the military regime in Port-au-Prince and the  naming of interim president Emile Jonassaint, whom Juppe described as a  "puppet with no legitimacy."

A tear-gas cannister was let off outside the  offices of the Japanese Embassy here on Friday, a day after Tokyo officials  decided to ban Argentine football hero Diego Maradona.
No members of the embassy staff were hurt in the attack, but two  Argentinians needed attention after inhaling the gas.
The embassy offices are located on the ninth floor of the Rio de la Plata  office building.
Leaflets criticising the Japanese decision, written by the self-proclaimed  People's Revolutionary Organisation, were found in the surrounding streets.
The Japanese justice ministry refused Maradona a visa because it said he  had been implicated in drug cases more than once.
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for cocaine possession, and  five months later was given a 14-month suspended sentence by an Italian court  for using cocaine.
He was also suspended from international competition for 15 months in 1991  and 1992 after testing postive for cocaine use.
The justice ministry's immigration bureau, however, granted a visa to  Claudio Caniggia, who recently ended a 13-month soccer ban for his alleged use  of cocaine. Caniggia would have been allowed to go to Japan because he had not  faced criminal charges.
Argentina had planned to play Japan and France later this month in the  Kirin Cup as part of their World Cup buildup.

Blue-chip stocks continued to climb early Friday  as long-term interest rates fell after the report of a weaker-than-expected  rise in US consumer prices in April.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials was up 11.30 at 3,664.14  points 20 minutes after the session opened on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thursday the Dow rose 23.80 points to finish at 3,652.84.
On the bond market, the average interest rate on the bellwether 30-year  Treasury bond fell to 7.51 percent from 7.56 percent late Thursday.
The stock and bond markets rallied Thursday after the government announced  a surprising drop in wholesale prices in April.
Analysts said the dollar's firming was also encouraging gains on Wall  Street.
Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said traders were  fixated on next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open  Market Committee.
But a Fed increase in the federal funds rate was so widely anticipated, he  said, the move would have little impact on the markets.

An eight-year-old Palestinian  killed himself accidentally here Friday, playing with a Kalashnikov gun of the  new PLO police force, an AFP correspondent reported.
A woman was also injured in the accident at the former Israeli military  administration building which had been handed over to the policemen earlier in  the day.
The police closed off the area after the incident.

Israeli soldiers shot three  people on Friday as black-hooded Islamic fundamentalists led a protest against  Palestinian self-rule by several thousand Gazans, a correspondent reported.
Clashes erupted with soldiers as about 5,000 anti-autonomy protesters  marched through Gaza City after a mass rally in a football stadium.
Three Palestinians were taken to hospital with bullet wounds.
Mohsen Abu Eitah, a member of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS),  told the rally: "Opposing the autonomy agreement does not mean we will act in  a destructive way against our people."
"We oppose the agreement because Gaza-Jericho was never our dream," said   Ahmad Bahr, a senior HAMAS figure. "We are afraid that Gaza-Jericho is not  first but last."
Under the autonomy agreement between the PLO and Israel, Gaza and Jericho  are granted autonomy for five years. After two years, negotiations are set to  begin on the rest of the occupied territories, including Jerusalem.
"We ended up with only 45 percent of Gaza," he said referring to the  presence of 4,000 Jewish settlers and troops to protect them.
"I hope our police will not be an Israeli puppet."
Hundreds of HAMAS activists donned black hoods with cut-out eyes for the  rally which was also called by Islamic Jihad and the Popular and Democratic  Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP and DFLP).
The groups demanded the release of all Palestinian prisoners.

French aviation authorities seemed determined on  Friday to reject any flight plans filed by British Airways, Air UK or TAT  airline for Monday flights using Paris' Orly airport, reliable sources said  Friday.
Those companies have indicated their intention of launching service  between London and Orly on that day, even though France is opposed.
The sources noted that without an accepted flight plan, no pilot can take  off without violating international regulations and endangering his  passengers' lives.
But when asked about the matter, the French Transport Ministry - in charge  of the General Agency for Civil Aviation (DGAC), which deals with flight plans  - refused to comment on Friday except for saying that "all possible cases have  been contemplated and studied".
The British airlines, backed by their government, have insisted they are  entitled to start flights to Orly next week in the wake of a European Union  decision that France must open three routes to competition: Orly-London,  Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseille.
British Airways (BA) has said that "We have the rights and the slots, and  we will be starting our first London-to-Orly flights on Monday".
In London, a Civil Aviation Authority spokesman noted that the easiest way  in practice for the French to prevent BA and other airlines from serving Orly  was to reject the flight plan, which every pilot has to submit an hour before  takeoff.
But at the same time, a BA spokesman continued to maintain that "there  will be no problem" and no reason for flight plans to be filed Monday to be  turned down.
Sources close to French transport minister Bernard Bosson said Friday that  the French government did not in any way question "the principle of opening  the Orly-London route to British companies as soon as possible". But they said  it was normal for the government to reject a "fait accompli" that BA and some  other British companies were trying to put over.
A reliable source said the French government seems eager above all to  negotiate a reciprocity agreement with Britain before opening Orly to British  aircraft, as the European Commission has ordered. Air France and Air Outremer  have filed applications to use Heathrow airport in London which were rejected  on the ground that the airport is already too congested.
Until now, all flights to London from Paris have left from Roissy-Charles  de Gaulle airport, flying to four London airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted  and London City Airport.

Business inventories fell 0.2 percent in March  while sales rose 1.2 percent, the Commerce Department said Friday.
Many analysts had expected inventories to rise 0.1 percent.
In February, the backlog rose a revised 0.5 percent and sales were up a  revised 1.4 percent.

Russian deputies on Friday overwhelmingly approved  a bill for Russia to unilaterally lift sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia  despite an international embargo.
The action by the Duma, the lower house of parliament, came after the US  Senate voted Thursday that Washington should unilaterlaly allow US arms  shipments to the mainly Moslem Bosnian government in defiance of a 1991 UN  arms embargo.
With Russia a traditional ally of Serbia, lower house deputies have spoken  out before in favor of the rump Yugoslavia, but Friday's vote marked the first  time they have gone so far as to approve a bill -- in a crushing vote of 226  to 31 -- along these lines.
Friday's Duma resolution stipulated that in the event of a "unilateral  lifting by a state of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia," Russia would  have to respond with "adequate measures that could go as far as raising the  question of a unilateral exit from the sanctions regime."
The draft, approved on first reading, must be put to a second vote in two  weeks before it can go onto the upper hour, or Federation Council.
Though it was too early to tell whether it would make it through to law,  analysts said Friday's vote signaled a new defiance by the  conservative-dominated Duma towards Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
In earlier votes, the Duma voted overwhelmingly to condemn NATO air  strikes against Serb positions on April 9 and 10, or only urged the Russian  government to work for an end to lifting UN-imposed trade and arms sanctions  against rump Yugoslavia.
Friday's bill was laid before parliament on April 15 by a deputy from the  pro-communist Agrarian Party, and backed by Vladimir Zhirinovski's  ultranationalists and the Party of Democratic Russia of Nikolai Travkin, who  recently became a minister without portfolio.
The US Senate vote embarrassed the US administration, which says Bosnian  government forces should be allowed to defend themselves but wants any change  in sanctions to be multilateral.
The Senate move was seen as unlikely to be confirmed by Congress, but was  taken as a warning about Senate discontent over President Bill Clinton's  foreign policy.
Since the UN adopted sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia in 1992, the  Russian president has tried to navigate between pressure from the  international community and pressure from strong pro-Serb forces in parliament.
Deputy Vladimir Isakov, who is a legal expert and fierce opponent of the  Yeltsin government, said recently he had found a "hole" in the constitution  that would allow the Duma to override the president's foreign policy.
The article, number 80 in the constitution adopted last December, says the  Russian president conducts foreign policy "in line with federal legislation."

The Irish central bank on Friday lowered its key  directive short-term interest rate from 6.5, to 6.25 percent, effective next  Monday.
The previous cut, from 6.75 to 6.5 percent, came on April 15.
The move came two days after the German Bundesbank reduced its discount  and Lombard rates and was followed by a number of other European countries.
The short-term rate is the one most used by the Bank of Ireland in lending  to the banking system.

Marino Alonso gave the host country  their first stage victory in the 1994 Tour of Spain here on Friday in the  204km 19th stage from Avila to Palazuelos.
However Switzerland's Tony Rominger retained the leaders' yellow jersey he  has held since the prologue time-trial.
Alonso finished six minutes ahead of Italians Roberto Pagnin and Ricardo  Forconi in a successful long breakaway.

PLO leader Yasser Arafat said here Friday, as  Palestinian police took control of Jericho, that he aimed to travel to the  West Bank town in mid-June.
The Palestinians will hold elections "very soon," following the launch of  self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, he told reporters at PLO headquarters  in the Tunisian capital.
But Arafat said he was "not in a hurry" to complete the line-up of the  24-member Palestinian Authority to run Gaza and Jericho. So far, 15 members  have been named to the team, which the PLO leader is to chair.
Arafat and the European Commission vice president, Manuel Marin, earlier  signed accords for 12 million dollars in EU aid for the new Palestinian police  force and two million dollars to hold the elections.

"It's a first step," he said. "But if we are not listened to, then  something's got to happen."
Berger, now the most experienced and most successful driver in the  championship, has been a prominent figure on the issue of safety.
The Austrian said: "We have to look to the future.
"We must establish a short-term plan on security, particularly with the  inspection of the next three circuits, and afterwards, we must rapidly draw-up  a long-term plan."
The issue of whether to call off Sunday's race was not brought up by the  association.
Motor racing's blue riband event is set to go ahead, according to  organisers, although drivers and the Principality's Prince Rainier may have a  change of heart should Wendlinger's condition deteriorate.
The Austrian was still in a deep coma on Friday, with one doctor saying  that the next 48 hours are likely to be decisive.

Arafat and the European Commission vice president, Manuel Marin, earlier  signed accords for 12 million dollars in EU aid for the new Palestinian police  force and two million dollars to hold the elections.

Denmark intends backing the creation of a  sanctuary for whales in the Antarctic at this month's meeting in Mexico of the  International Whaling Commission, sources at the environment and foreign  ministries said here Friday.
Parliament's environment committee gave its agreement in principle this  week and is due to give full endorsement next Wednesday, provided Greenland  gets a supplementary quota for catching rorquals off the island.
Denmark abstained in last year's vote. The policy change should ensure a  two-thirds majority for the sanctuary this time, the environment ministry  sources said.
The Danish branch of the ecological movement Greenpeace said it was  delighted with the decision. Greenpeace spokeswoman Kirsten Sander alleged  that Japan had tried to buy off the votes of five small IWC member states,  which she did not name.
On Thursday Greenpeace welcomed Chile's decision to support the sancutary  proposal, saying indicated President Eduardo Frei's new government "is willing  to act boldly on global environmental issues."
The Danish and Chilean announcements supporting a Southern Ocean whale  sanctuary proposal will virtually assure the sancutary's passage by the  International Whaling Commission (IWC) this month, Greenpeace said Thursday.

China has indicated its readiness to consider  possible voluntary export restraints to curb the explosive growth in Chinese  textile exports to Japan, government sources were quoted as saying Friday.
The evening edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted international trade  and industry sources as saying that Chinese trade officials had informed the  ministry they were "studying" introduction of export controls.
The newspaper said the Chinese move was aimed at discouraging Japan from  restricting imports of textiles from China under the 1974 multilateral fibre  arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
But it also noted that a bilateral deal to "voluntarily" restrict the flow  of textile trade between the two countries could attract international  criticism of Japan while damaging China's bid to join the GATT.
The ministry refused to confirm the report but did say that Yukio Doi,  director general of its consumer goods industries bureau, was scheduled to  visit Beijing from May 23 for "regular" talks with Chinese trade officials.
Japan's imports of Chinese textile soared 31 percent to almost eight  billion dollars in the year to March, accounting for almost half of the  overall 24 percent jump in imports from the country to 21.7 billion dollars.
Japanese and Chinse officials, meanwhile, ended two days of economic  consultations here Friday, government sources said.
Chinse officials from the State Planning Commission were quoted as telling  officials from Japan's International Trade and Industry Ministry that retail  prices in China in the first three months of this year jumped about 20 percent  from a year earlier.
News reports said that the officials agreed to discuss Japan's industrial  cooperation with China in the field of motor vehicle parts.

Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa agreed  Friday with US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to resume stalled framework  trade talks between their two countries, officials said.
The agreement was reached when the two ministers talked by telephone for  about 20 minutes, the Japanese officials said.
"The two countries should have contacts as soon as possible," Kakizawa was  quoted as saying. Kantor agreed with the Japanese foreign minister.
News reports said here that Japan and the United States were expected to  hold subcabinet-level talks next week in Washington to discuss bilateral trade.
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs at the  International Trade and Industry Ministry, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy  foreign minister for economic affairs, are expected to represent Japan at the  meeting, the reports said.
Framework talks, mainly designed to cut Japan's chronic huge trade surplus  with the United States, have been suspended since February.
In February in Washington, then Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa  told US President Bill Clinton that Japan could not accept US demands to set  numerical targets in cutting its trade surplus.
Hosokawa said that such targets would undermine the free trade system and  lead to managed trade.

One elephant died and another was in a  critical condition from injuries sustained when they were recaptured following  their escape from an enclosure at a private reserve north of Natal province,  Business Day reported Friday.
The daily said the two female victims and eight other members of their  family had escaped Tuesday from a special enclosure at the Phinda reserve  where they were being held temporarily following their transfer only 24 hours  earlier from Kruger's National Park.
They were recaptured Wednesday by rescue teams that used tranquilizers but  one of the elephants died the following day and another one was in a critical  condition, the daily said.
The herd was part of a group of 158 elephants that faced a certain death  at Kruger's National Park where officials annually kill about 350 elephants in  order to maintain a balance in the park's "eco-system" and its elephant  population, which varies between 7,000 and 8,000.
An international animal protection group had spared them that fate earlier  this month by organizing the transfer of the 158 elephants to eight reserves  throughout South Africa.
But prior to releasing the animals in their new habitat, they were to be  placed in special enclosures for 24 hours in order to get used to the change  in environment.
Another group of elephants transferred to a reserve in Transvaal province  also reportedly escaped from its enclosure.

The Greek drachma was again under sharp pressure on  Friday six weeks before the European Union's full liberalization of the  capital market, and Greece threw part of its reserves into propping up the  currency.
The drachma had come under speculative attack on Wednesday, which resumed  in full force on Friday after a holiday, forcing the Bank of Greece to step in  to support the currency against the German mark and the dollar, Athens forex  traders said.
Iorgos Kondoyorgis, vice-president of Citibank Greece, said banking  authorities had thrown 500 to 600 million dollars onto the forex market on  Friday, though the country's foreign exchange reserves were only around nine  billion dollars.
At the close, the drachma was maintained at 147.70 to the mark and 247.10  to the dollar, slightly up from Wednesday levels.
"There is no question, it is out of the question and it will never be a  question for the government to devalue - that's clear and the market knows  it", said government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos.
Greek European affairs minister Theodore Pangalos ruled out the idea that  full liberalization of the EU capital market be deferred, as some opposition  members have demanded. "That decision (liberalization) will have no effect on  the drachma. It will lead only to losses for the speculators", he said.
But such statements do not seem to have convinced experts, who think the  current turbulence is very serious. "If speculation continues at this rate,  half of the reserves will melt away in a few days and a monetary adjustment  will become likely", one European expert told AFP. He said the drachma is now  overvalued by 10 to 20 percent.

Blue-chip stocks on Wall Street lost ground  Friday following a slight rise in long-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials fell 2.68 points to 3,650.16  at 11:00 a.m. (1500 GMT) from Thursday's close at 3,652.84. Trading was active  with 85 million shares changing hands.
The market was up in opening trading, getting a boost from a drop in  average rates for 30-year Treasury bonds to 7.51 percent from 7.56 percent  Thursday.
But when the Treasury rate clicked back up to 7.54 percent, stock prices  fell.

US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he  had agreed Friday with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need for  preliminary contacts to resume bilateral trade talks.
The so-called framework agreement negotiations collapsed last February  over a dispute of how to measure progress in opening Japan's market and  reducing its 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Washington.

The Palestinians took control  of Jericho and half the Gaza Strip on Friday as hundreds of PLO soldiers  poured in to police the first autonomous enclaves, sparking mass celebrations.
"As of now, you are the commander of the region. I wish you good luck,"   Israel's central region military commander General Ilan Biran told Palestine  Liberation Army (PLA) General Hajj Ismail.
They shook hands and the transfer of power in the first autonomous enclave  was complete. Twenty-seven years of occupation came to an end.
"Thank you," Ismail replied through an interpreter. "I hope we will be  successful together on the road to peace."
He called for Israel to withdrawal from all the occupied territories.
In Tunis, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat announced he intended to travel to  the West Bank town in mid-June.
The Israelis completed their pullback to border checkpoints round the  62-square-kilometre (37-sq.-mile) zone.
As the generals' handshake lingered, buses carrying about 400 policemen  edged their way through the crowds lining the road from the Allenby Bridge  over the River Jordan.
They were cheered all the way by youths shouting "Allah u Akbar" (God is  great). In the central square, hundreds more awaited. Women ululated, holding  their children up to touch the soldiers.
Bands struck up and youngsters sang and danced.
The Palestinians had already raised their red, green, white and black flag  over Jericho before dawn when official buildings and a military base were  handed over to 60 police officers who had slipped in overnight and Thursday.
Only half-a-dozen taxi-drivers were awake to witness the event. But word  spread fast and whole families flooded on to the streets to hail their heroes.
"The Israeli flag had been brought down by the time we came in," said  Ahmad Abu Saadeh, a newly-arrived policeman. "There were no more Israeli  soldiers left, we didn't shake hands with any of them."
The Palestinians took over the police station, military administration  buildings, the post office, a court house, and a nearby synagogue.

Meanwhile, Israel completed a redeployment from all the southern Gaza  Strip, apart from Jewish settlements which remain under army protection.
"Everything south of the river is in the hands of the Palestinian police,"  a senior Israeli military official said. The river, Wadi Gaza, cuts across the  Strip south of the Jewish settlement of Netzarim.
During the night security installations were evacuated at Khan Yunes, the  last town in the south to be evacuated following Deir el-Balah, Bureij,  Nusseirat and Rafah.
Facilities in Gaza City were to be handed over Sunday and transfer of  authority wrapped up on Wednesday.
Unlike the over-crowded Strip, population nearly 800,000, the Jericho  police will run a quiet oasis of 15,000 people, known as the world's oldest  and lowest town at 250 metres (825 feet) below sea level.
Palestinian officials said more than 1,600 soldiers had so far poured in  to Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
A total of 9,000 are to be deployed across Gaza and Jericho, most drawn  from the PLA, and named the Palestinian National Security Forces. About 1,500  will be deployed in Jericho.
"Yes, we're already starting to direct traffic," said Mahmoud Yussef, an  officer who stood in the middle of a Jericho road, shaking hands and embracing  well-wishers amid long lines of cars.
"We will work day and night, all the time. We don't need to sleep, we feel  rested now that we are in our land."
Soldiers unloaded their belongings at the new headquarter, the former  Hanan camp, a compound that housed the military administration and now renamed  Al-Aqsa, after the name of a unit from Iraq.
But, there was more jubilation than work on the compound. Children were  especially excited by the Kalashnikov rifles the soldiers carried.
And the triumphant takeover was marred by the death of an eight-year-old  Palestinian, Ammar el-Shawa, who killed himself playing with a rifle. A woman  and an elderly man were also hurt in the accident at the former Israeli  military administration building.
"It's the first time I've seen a gun up close, and not in Israeli hands,"  said Khamis Ahmad, 12, before the tragedy. Like the others, he undid the parts  of the rifle, cocked it and took aim.
"Don't worry, the guns have no bullets," said Abu Emad, a soldier.
The police closed off the area after the death of Shawa, their first  intervention.
In Gaza City, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded three people as  black-hooded Islamic fundamentalists led a protest against Palestinian  self-rule by several thousand Gazans.

Kantor
(RECASTS - details of statement)
WASHINGTON, May 13 (AFP) - US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he  had agreed Friday with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need for  preliminary contacts to resume bilateral trade talks.
The so-called framework agreement negotiations collapsed last February  because of a dispute over how to measure progress in opening Japan's market  and reducing its 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.
In Tokyo, officials said Kakizawa had agreed to resume the stalled  framework talks, but Kantor's statement spoke only of preliminary contacts.
"Ambassador Kantor agreed with the suggestion of Foreign Minister Kakizawa  on the need for preliminary contact between both sides to explore the basis  for resumption of the framework talks," the statement said.
"They both shared the hope that a basis will emerge for the resumption of  the framework talks before the July G7 meeting in Naples," it said.
Kakizawa called Kantor and they discussed the issue for 30 minutes, the  statement said.

An eight-year-old Palestinian     killed himself accidentally here on Friday playing with a Kalashnikov gun of  the new PLO police force, an AFP correspondent reported.
A woman and a man were also injured in the accident at the former Israeli  military administration building which had been handed over to the policemen  earlier in the day.
The boy Ammar el-Shawa was killed on the spot.
A Jericho hospital official said the woman, Om Nasser el-Shawa, 55, had  five bullet wounds in the abdomen, and the 65-year-old man was was injured in  the thigh. Both were transported to Maqassad hospital in Jerusalem.
It was not immediately clear if the trio were related.
Palestinian police officers refused to comment on the death, but the area  around the building was sealed off.
Children celebrating the transfer of Jericho to the Palestinian police  during the day were playing with guns at the administration building, the  policemen's new headquarters.
Most guns were not loaded. However those belonging to senior officers had  bullets in them.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin  announced plans Friday with top German investors for new transport links by  road and by rail between Moscow and Berlin.
Yeltsin, who met with 14 German business leaders on the final day of his  visit to Germany, said businessmen had agreed to help finance the construction  of a new high-speed highway between the two cities as well as a railway system.
"We agreed on building a Moscow-Berlin Autobahn", Yeltsin told reporters,  using the German term to describe the highway.
Earlier in Bonn, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told Yeltsin that a treaty  of association between Russia and the European Union would be at the top of  Germany's agenda during its forthcoming presidency of the EU.
German Transport Minister Matthias Wissman confirmed here that the road  and rail projects were in the works but stressed that large private  investments would be needed to finance such a venture.
Wissman said, quoting Yeltsin, that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had agreed to  help find financial backing from European partners.
Industry leader Eberhard von Koerber confirmed the German government was  committed to building the vital links that would boost trade between Russia  and western Europe.
He also said that Yeltsin had pressed German representatives to invest in  defence conversion projects, stating that they should not let their Japanese  and American counterparts get the upper hand in that choice area of Russia's  economy.
Russia's defence plants and factories are considered to be the most  efficient in that country.
There were also complaints from German business over continued high  inflation in Russia and one major industry chief pointed the guilty finger at  the Russian central bank.
"The central bank is a money printing machine" said Otto Wolff von  Amerongen, leader of an influential German commission overseeing investment in  eastern Europe.
Amerongen told Yeltsin that German businessmen wanted to invest in Russia  but that certain conditions had to be met.
He asserted that ever-changing taxation laws needed to be fine-tuned and  that inflation, currently at a monthly rate of nine percent, needed to be  brought down.
Yeltsin spent the last day of his visit to Germany in Stuttgart, the  electronics and high technology hub of Germany.
The Russian leader visited the Alcatel-SEL communications plant and spoke  to his wife Naina who was visiting a nearby historic fortress from a computer  terminal equipped with a video screen.
"We don't have anything like this in Russia", he commented.
Alcatel-SEL has developed business ties in Saint Petersburg since 1992 and  has recently signed a contract with an electronics firm in the Ural region of  Ufa.
Yeltsin left for Moscow later in the afternoon.
Earlier in Bonn the Kinkel said in a statement that he had pledged Bonn  would make the treaty "one of the top priorities of the German presidency of  the Union."
Bonn takes over the six-month rotating presidency from Greece on July 1.
Kinkel expressed hopes Russia would soon play an active role in European  security policy by joining the NATO-proposed Partnership for Peace programme.
"President Yelstin stressed Russia had no difficulty (with the accord) and  would sign soon," the statement said. "But Russia wishes to set out in a  protocol the specific content of the cooperation between NATO and Russia."
German government spokesman Dieter Vogel said talks with Yeltsin had  "provided an opportunity to move forward on this question."
Kinkel, echoing an earlier pledge by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also  reassured Yeltsin that Germany would back Russian efforts to obtain full  membership of the GATT world trade accord and of the G7 group of most  industrialised countries.
The proposed partnership offers former Warsaw Pact countries closer  military cooperation with the alliance but stops short of giving them full  membership.

Rebels and government soldiers battled with small  arms and mortars in Kigali on Friday after the bodies of 88 fresh massacre  victims were discovered in southern Rwanda.
Many of those victims were young girls.
It was unclear who had carried out the slaughter, which adds to a death  toll that has topped 200,000 in little more than a month of ethnic carnage,  said UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said.
"We thought that massacres in the Butare region had stopped, but it seems  they are continuing," Kabia said.
Hutu-led government forces control most of the Butare area, though  fighting with the rebels, mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, has been  reported nearby.
The boom of artillery shells and the crack of Kalashnikov rifles sent  civilians scurrying for cover in the capital Friday.
Most of the heavy fire apparently came from positions held by the rebel  Rwanda Patriotic Front around the Meridien Hotel, while gunbattles raged  between small groups in various neighbourhoods.
Fighting also continued in the northwestern town of Ruhengeri and in  Bugesera, in the south, Kabia said.
Hutu killing squads embarked on a bloody rampage through Kigali after  president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed in a suspicious plane crash  on April 6.
The rebels retaliated by sweeping through northern and eastern Rwanda,  seizing control of two-thirds of the small central African highland nation,  and pounding army positions in the capital.
Children and women were clubbed or hacked to death with machetes as  militiamen giggled at their agony, according to witnesses. Many survivors are  children with their feet or hands cut off, and horrifically mutilated women.
Bernard Kouchner, the flamboyant former French humanitarian action  minister and founder of the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors  Without Borders), met rebel leader Paul Kagame on Friday in the first of what  he said was a series of meetings with Rwandan leaders to assess aid needs.
Kouchner arrived from Uganda by road Thursday in what he said was the  launch of an effort to boost aid operations on his own initiative.
"I'm here wearing my own hat. That's to say none at all," Koucher said.
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have fled across the borders to find  themselves in squalid makeshift camps in Tanzania, Burundi or elsewhere.
Up to two million Rwandans have abandoned their homes in terror of being  slaughtered, with 20,000 alone prisoners sheltering in a church, a sports  stadium, a hotel and other locations in their own capital, defenceless against  mortar shells that sometimes slam into their refuges.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is lobbying the Security  Council to reinforce its troops, down to 400 after the UN Assistance Mission  in Rwanda last month evacuated most of its 2,500 soldiers who were supervising  a ceasefire implemented under peace accords signed in August.
Boutros-Ghali has asked for 5,500 troops in Rwanda to establish a neutral  zone around the airport, escort relief convoys and assist displaced people.
The United Nations, still shaken by its failure to enforce peace in  Somalia, is reluctant to embark on an aggressive mission that could embroil  its peacekeepers in clashes with either side, diplomats said.

Three people were killed and set  alight after being accused of practising witchcraft in a remote village in  South Africa's Northern Transvaal province, police said Friday.
The three were killed late Wednesday by villagers in GaMogano, according  to police, quoted by the domestic SAPA news agency.
The deaths bring to 67 the number of people murdered this year after being  accused of being witches in this superstitious tribal area, the news agency  said.
African National Congress premier for the province, Ngoako Ramathlodi,  said "harsher penalties" would be imposed on people guilty of killing people  they believed were are witches.

European, Russian and US foreign ministers meeting  in Geneva to try to agree upon rekindled peace efforts for Bosnia-Hercegovina  extended their talks Friday beyond the originally expected duration.
A press conference after the talks which had been set for 5:00 p.m. was  now expected round 7:00 p.m. (1700 GMT), a US source said. The meeting is  taking place at the American embassy.
Diplomats earlier said a joint statement could be issued calling for a  ceasefire and stating the desired principles of a political settlement.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is attending the meeting, as is  Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev and their Belgian, British, French,  German and Greek counterparts, as well as a representative of the European  Union.

FIA president Max Mosley announced revolutionary  measures in Formula One here on Friday hours after drivers joined together to  form a pressure group to improve safety.
Cars will need to be radically adapted by the grand prixs in Spain (May  29), Canada (June 12) and Germany (July 31).
The sport is still reeling from the accident of Austrian Karl Wendlinger  on Thursday, which has left him in a deep coma, and the deaths of Roland  Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna two weeks ago at the San Marino grand prix.
At a press conference, Mosley ordered a reduction in the size of the  diffusers and a change of the frontwing -- both measures will reduce downforce  and cut speed -- by May 29.
By June 12, more side protection must be installed in driver cockpits to  protect the driver's head. And the weight of the car will be increased by  25kg. Air boxes, behind and above the driver's head, will be banned.
The front suspension must also be strengthened to ensure wheels do not  fall off. The cockpit will also be lengthened, and special fuel will be banned  with only pump fuel from a list of 100 petrol stations allowed.
By the German grand prix on July 31, all the measures due to be introduced  in 1995, particularly in the area of aerodynamics, will be in force six months  early.
Cars will no longer be flat on the bottom, but will have a "step" in them,  according to Mosley. This would mean a speed reduction of cars, particularly  at corners. Adaptations to front and rear wings will also be introduced with  the same aim.
Engine power, still according to Mosley, will be reduced from 800 horse  power to about 600 by use of a fuel-flow valve. The valve will control the  flow of fuel to the engine, therefore reducing a car's power without reducing  engine size. Finally, to allow for all these changes, the weight of the cars  will be increased from 575kg to 625kg.
On Sunday's Monaco grand prix itself, organisers said it was set to go  ahead, although drivers and the Principality's Prince Rainier may have a  change of heart should Wendlinger's condition deteriorate.
The Austrian was still in a deep coma on Friday, with one doctor saying  that the next 48 hours are likely to be decisive.
All the current world championship drivers were at the pressure group  meeting, along with three currently without a team -- Britain's Derek Warwick,  Frenchman Patrick Tambay and Italian Riccardo Patrese.
Such a drivers' group had been set up during the 1970s, but petered out in  the early 1980s. Drivers have been without any formal representation within  the FIA for several years.

France is determined to prevent British airlines  from carrying out plans to break the French stranglehold on flights into  Paris' Orly airport next week, transport ministry sources said Friday.
British Airways, Air UK and TAT airlines say they will ignore France's  refusal to allow them to use the busy international airport south of Paris and  will launch services between London and Orly on Monday, as permitted by a  European Commission ruling.
But the French sources underlined that without an accepted flight plan, no  pilot can take off without violating international regulations and endangering  his passengers' lives.
When asked about the matter, a spokesman for the transport ministry, which  is in charge of the General Agency for Civil Aviation (DGAC) that handles  flight plans, refused to comment, simply saying: "all possible cases have been  contemplated and studied."
The British airlines, backed by their government, are insisting they are  entitled to start flights to Orly next week in line with a European Union  ruling ordering France to open three domestic routes to competition:  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseille.
British Airways (BA) has said: "We have the rights and the slots, and we  will be starting our first London-to-Orly flights on Monday." The British  government has expressed its "full support" for the airline.
In London, a Civil Aviation Authority spokesman noted that the easiest way  in practice for the French to prevent BA and other airlines from serving Orly  was to reject the flight plan, which every pilot has to submit an hour before  takeoff.
But at the same time, a BA spokesman continued to maintain that "there  will be no problem" and no reason for flight plans to be filed Monday to be  turned down. The first scheduled flight to Orly is due to leave Heathrow  airport at 6:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday and arrive in Paris an hour later.
Sources at the French transport ministry said Friday that the French  government did not in any way question "the principle of opening the  Orly-London route to British companies as soon as possible."
But they said it was normal for the government to reject a "fait accompli"  that BA and some other British companies were trying to put over.
Transport Minister Bernard Bosson has said France accepts the idea in  principle but needs extra time to deal with such difficulties as overcrowding  at Orly, environmental problems and reciprocal access to London airports.
Foreign competition through Orly is also seen as a threat to the  loss-making national carrier Air France and its domestic subsidiary Air Inter.  Unions at Air Inter have called a strike for Tuesday in protest over the  opning of the routes.
The routes through Orly are coveted by foreign companies because all  domestic French flights leave from the airport.
Orly has 204,000 incoming and outgoing flights per year compared to  304,000 at the bigger Charles de Gaulle international airport north of the  capital.
Last year, 9.7 million passengers used the Orly-Sud international part of  the terminal while 15.7 million passed through Orly-Ouest, reserved for the  domestic carrier Air-Inter.
French analysts believe British airlines are keen to capture the estimated  half a million French passengers who use Air Inter each year to fly to Paris  to catch a foreign connection.
Orly also is more easily accessible by car from Paris, though rail  connections are inferior and the terminal closes part of the night, unlike the  Charles de Gaulles airport.
The ministry source said the French government was eager above all to  negotiate a reciprocity agreement with Britain before opening Orly to British  aircraft, as the European Commission has ordered.
Air France and Air Outremer have filed applications to use Heathrow  airport in London which were rejected on grounds that the airport is already  too congested.
Until now, all flights to London from Paris have left from Roissy-Charles  de Gaulle airport, flying to four London airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted  and London City Airport.

The volume of trading and prices were lower in most  sectors of the tanker market compared with the previous week, London brokers  E.A. Gibson said Friday in their weekly review.
Out of the Middle East there was disappointing demand for the Very and  Ultra Large Crude Carriers (VLCC and ULCC, over 200,000 tonnes) business while  prices showed little change.
Events in the Yemen have resulted in higher prices for the 80,000-tonne  carriers out of this region.
In West Africa, rates continued their freefall while the Mediterranean  business suffered again from a lack of interest.
In the Caribbean market, rates were also lower while in the North Sea  owners were just able to maintain last week levels.
In the clean business, there was continued interest for the Middle East  sector but in the Mediterranean demand has been just sufficient to keep rates  stable.

France launched its bid to bring the Golden  Palm back home Friday with the long-awaited "La Reine Margot," a lavish  historical drama billed as the most gripping film on the Croisette.
But, at the end of the first full day of the 47th Cannes International  Film Festival, there was some scepticism as to whether the film could do the  job for France.
"It is too long," said one critic emerging from a preview of the film,  which has its public premiere in Grand Theatre Lumiere here Friday evening.  "Too aesthetic," said another.
The film, starring Isabelle Adjani and Daniel Auteuil, tells the story of  Marguerite of Valois, forced to marry for political expediency in August 1572,  in the heat of the French wars of religion.
The makers of the film, directed by Patrice Chereau, were promoting the  film Friday as a gripping action film which will keep cinema-goers on the edge  of their seats for nearly three hours.
"What we are trying to do is grab the cinema audience and not to let them  go for a second," screen writer Daniele Thompson told Agence France-Presse in  a pre-premiere interview.
"It is a brutal film, like a thriller or a western. It is not a  sentimental film," he said, accurately describing the two and three-quarter  hour epic, full-blooded in more than one sense.
From the opening frame the film pulls no punches in depicting the  brutality of the time, culminating in the Saint Bartholomew Day's Massacre of  August 23 and 24, when up to 100,000 protestants died.
Margot's sexual adventures -- her marriage puts no bars on these -- are  also included liberally in the mixture, a somewhat free interpretation of the  novel by Alexandre Dumas.
The film will be attempting to bring the Golden Palm back to France seven  years after Maurice Pialat took the top prize with "Under Satan's Sun" in  1987. "Margot" has been widely promoted as France's strongest prospect here.
At a press conference for the film ahead of the premiere Friday night the  film's makers were clearly irritated by a question about it possibly being cut  for US distribution.
Adjani showed obvious pleasure with her own performance in the film: "I am  very proud and very grateful to Patrice Chereau. He made it possible for me to  be beautiful, passionate, in love, unhappy," she said.
Two other French offerings, "Grosse Fatigue" (Very Tired) by Michel Blanc  and "Les Patriotes" by Eric Rochant, have fewer hopes pinned to them than  Chereau's epic, estimated to have cost 23 million dollars to produce.
France's bid to retake the Palm follows its row with the United States  over the inclusion of a cultural exemption clause for audio-visual industry in  a global world trade agreement.
France protests that without government protection indigenous film  industries will be overwhelmed by the juggernaut of the major US film studios.
The other film premiered Friday was "Du Li Shi Dai" (Confucian Confusion)  by Taiwanese director Edward Yang, who told AFP that his story, of cultural  confusion in Asia, should be appreciated worldwide.
"I don't think it's referring just to Taiwan, it's referring to Hong Kong,  Korea, Japan and Singapore, all the confucian-influenced societies," he said  in an interview with AFP.
"If I've done a good job to tell a human story then people from other  parts of the world will appreciate it," he said, adding: "I wouldn't be  surprised at it because we're all human."
On Saturday the festival continues with "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious  Circle" by Alan Rudolph, and Russian Andrei Konchalovsky's "Assia and the  Chicken with Golden Eggs."

PLO leader Yasser Arafat said here Friday, as  Palestinian police took control of Jericho, that he aimed to travel to the  West Bank town in mid-June.
The Palestinians will hold elections "very soon," following the launch of  self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, he told reporters at PLO headquarters  in the Tunisian capital.
The elections were originally to have taken place in July but have been  delayed until October.
Arafat, however, said he was "not in a hurry" to complete the line-up of  the 24-member Palestinian Authority to run Gaza and Jericho. So far, only 15  members have been named to the team, which the PLO leader is to chair.
The elections would also need thorough preparation, warned Arafat. "We  cannot rely on the data provided by the Israelis" to draw up electoral lists  and for other administrative tasks.
Arafat and the European Commission vice president, Manuel Marin, earlier  signed accords for 12 million dollars in EU aid for the new Palestinian police  force and two million dollars to hold the elections.
"Things have started to move in a more flexible way than before," said the  PLO leader, welcoming the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Jericho.
Marin said the start of Palestinian self-rule was an "event of the  century," ranking alongside the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He said the European Commission had accepted an offer from Arafat to set  up an office in Jericho to help the Palestinian Authority.
The EU was also to finance the building of a new 200-bed hospital in Gaza  City, he said, apart from helping the launch of Palestinian television and  radio stations.

Pete Sampras moved into the semi-finals of the  Italian Open on Friday with the spectre of the French Open dogging his every  move just 10 days before the start of the grand slam event.
The 22-year-old world number one defeated home star Andrea Gaudenzi 6-3,  7-5, in just under two hours on centre court at the Foro Italico.
The opening game of the second set went to seven break points before  Gaudenzi, the world number 45, finally held. "I had many opportunities," said  Sampras, who admits his toughest test so far this charmed year will come on  the clay at Roland Garros.
In his first week of 1994 on clay, Sampras has dispatched four European  specialists in a fine effort from a man who would always rather be playing on  a hardcourt.
"My tennis has gotten better and better as the week has gone on, I was  pretty happy with the way that I played," he said.
The centre court crowd were staunchly on the side of Gaudenzi, whistling  down some of Sampras' better efforts against their man.
"I've learned to take my time when playing a guy in this country. I knew  Gaudenzi would be playing with a lot of emotion. It was good to win the first  set -- that took the crowd out of the match," Sampras said.
While Sampras had to fight for victory, eighth seed Boris Becker eased  into the semi-finals through the back door as second-seeded German opponent  Michael Stich withdrew prior to their quarter-final match with back pain.
Becker will face Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic in the semi-finals. The fourth  seed defeated Holland's Jacco Eltingh 7-6 (7/5), 6-3.

Refugees fleeing clashes around the key Yemeni  town of Al Daleh gathered at Aden's busy qat market on Friday eagerly awaiting  the arrival of mountain traders with news from the front.
Despite limited resources, authorities in this southern stronghold were  doing their best to cope with a tide of refugees which could grow with  northern and southern troops locked in a grim struggle for control of Al Daleh.
Schools across the port city were being used as makeshift shelters and  basic foodstuffs were being made available, as the war raged on for a second  week.
But the unofficial qat market has become the place for information as  mountain traders bring down from Al Daleh their crops of the green leaf, which  when chewed can produce a mild intoxication.
Heated discussions broke out among the refugees trading stories about the  war between northern units loyal to President Ali Abdallah Salah and the  southern forces of Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid.
"Al Daleh hasn't fallen. I've just come from there, but the bombings  continue without let up," said one farmer.
Others around him disagreed, but an hour later the qat from Al Daleh --  known as the best in the mountains -- had still not arrived.
Al Daleh commands a strategic position in the mountains on the road to a  key southern air base, making it the target of a push southwards by Saleh's  troops.
Tanks and multiple rocket-launchers rumbled Friday along the 35-kilometre  (23-mile) road out of Aden, while airplanes screamed overhead. In the distance  firing could be heard.
Most of the refugees depend on qat for their livelihoods, but fled their  homes carrying with them only a few possessions such as a mattress and some  food as the fighting edged closer.
One worker with an international aid organisation said the road to Al  Daleh was still open, as northern troops had apparently not succeeded in  breaking through southern defences.
Northern forces said Thursday they had captured the town 90 kilometres (55  miles) north of Aden. But the south said it had retaken the positions in a  counter offensive.
Despite the claims and counter-claims, nobody here doubted that Al Daleh  and its 7,000 residents had been dealt a severe blow, amid reports that the  town's hospital had been evacuated.
Some 70 villagers from Al Uwaraah also arrived Thursday in Aden from Al  Uwaraah, fleeing shelling.
They have been temporarily housed in a school in an Aden suburb, where the  first emergency was the birth of a baby boy.
The mother Hamida sat on the floor of an unfurnished classroom surrounded  by other women, her eyes saddened and troubled by fears for the future.
Only her husband remained with the women, the other men having left to  attend Friday prayers in the mosques or to search for an empty apartment to  squat in, rather than the camp offer by the local governor.
Supplies of vegetable oil, sugar, a sack of Indian rice and soap powder  provided by the southern authorities were stacked in a corner of the  schoolyard.
Meanwhile, Sanaa announced that northern reinforcements had been sent to  Al Daleh, close to the old border between the former North and South Yemen  which were unified in May 1990.

Leading European stock markets were mixed on  Friday, as the London bourse lost 0.6 percent but prices rose moderately in  Paris and Frankfurt.
London traders said prices there had been affected by the futures market's  decline and the prospect of a rise in US interest rates next week. On the last  day of the trading account, the Footsie 100-share index lose 18.6 points or  0.6 percent to finish at 3,119.2, though it had opened with a slight gain of  3.7 points. Gilts gained up to 3/4 of a point.
Share volume was 699 million, little changed from 701.4 million on  Thursday.
Among the most active issues, Unilever plummeted 57 pence to end at 1,023  pence after announcing a smaller-than-expected rise in net profit for the  first quarter.
Cable and Wireless was down five to 455, affected by worries about  competition for its Mercury portable phone subsidiary. British Airways was off  five to 391 after announcing it was maintaining flights between London and  Paris-Orly despite the French government's opposition.
RTZ rose 10 pence to 858 on brokers' buy recommendations, while the  Telegraph Group was up nine to 620 on good quarterly results.
The Paris Bourse was helped by a slight dip in long-term interest rates  and the CAC 40 index gained 0.47 percent on the day to end at 2,187.00 points,  after an opening rise of 0.26 percent. The indicator had been up as much as  1.36 percent during the session before easing back in late afternoon.
The Bourse was closed on Thursday.
One operator commented that while the Bourse had not forgotten fears of  higher US interst rates, it was encouraged on Friday by good employment  figures in France and satisfactory results reported by some French companies.
LVMH luxury goods group gained 1.01 percent on the day, Generale des Eaux  0.38, and Michelin 1.29 percent. L'Oreal advanced 2.44 percent.
The Frankfurt stock market notched up a respectable gain on Friday, though  trading was narrow because of a long Ascension weekend being taken by many  investors, traders said. The DAX index finished the day at 2,258.75 points, up  0.67 percent by comparison with the Wednesday close (Thursday having been a  holiday).
Traders said the Friday gain was partly due to the Bundesbank's surprise  decision on Wednesday to lower both the discount and the Lombard rate by half  a point, said one broker from Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
He said the market expects further rate cuts, but that has already been  taken into account in share prices. "Investors are now more intent on company  results" than on German monetary policy, he said.
The Friday session's star was Metallgesellschaft, which rocketed up 42  marks to end at 285 following a buy recommendation by Union Bank of  Switzerland.
Banks performed well, Commerzbank rising 1.50 marks to 364.50 and Dresdner  Bank 3.50 to 405.50, while Deutsche Bank was unchanged at 791.50 marks.
Allianz rose 52 marks to 2,697 and Daimler six to 893, but Siemens was off  0.70 to 731.80.
The bond market rose, boosted by the Bundesbank move, and the average  yield on government issues fell by 0.03 percent to 6.32 percent.

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right  coalition drafted a bill Friday making it a crime punishable by up to three  years in prison for anyone to deny that the Holocaust took place.
Members of the coalition said they would present the bill to the  Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, next week so that it could be voted  into law later this year.
Denying that the Nazis murdered millions of Jews in death camps during  World War II is currently not a crime in Germany, although numerous courts  have punished culprits by convicting them for inciting racial hatred or  defaming the dead.
But the federal court of justice, Germany's highest court, ruled in March  that denying that the Holocaust existed did not amount to inciting racial  hatred.
The ruling sparked widespread outrage with Ignatz Bubis, a leader of the  Jewish community in Germany, saying that it amounted "to a handbook on how to  deny Auschwitz existed without being punished."
Bubis at the time also called for the adoption of a law specifically  making it a crime to deny the Holocaust.
The government of former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, a Social-Democrat,  attempted in the 1980s to adopt such a law but dropped the issue as neo-Nazis  sympathies were not on the rise at the time.
The tide has changed, however, in recent years with Germany increasingly  becoming the focus of international attention because of a rise in xenophobia  and racially motivated attacks on foreigners.

A tobacco company patented a process to make a  safer cigarette in 1966 but dropped the idea amid fears it would make its  other products look bad, The New York Times said Friday.
The abandoned step would have heated the tobacco instead of burning it,  eliminating the process that creates most of the hazardous substances in  tobacco smoke, the Times reported.
The Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., a subsidiary of the London-based  British-American Tobacco PLC, tested the process in a cigarette code-named  Ariel and was granted a patent in 1966 but decided to shelve the idea, the  daily said, citing internal company documents.
The company decided against bringing the safer cigarettes to market for  fear it would reflect poorly on its other products and out of concern that  smokers would find them less satisfying and therefore would not buy them, the  paper said, citing the documents and interviews with the scientists working on  the project.
Ariel was developed in the 1960s and the company applied for a patent in  1964. The Times said the documents indicate the Ariel cigarette would have  greatly reduced the cancer-causing substances in cigarette smoke and the  amount of secondhand smoke produced, as well as potential fire hazards.
But in 1964, company executives in various internal documents expressed  fear of disclosing too much harmful information about smoking and of  subsequent lawsuits, according to the daily.
The company shelved its research on both the hazards of cigarettes and  solutions to make them safer. The BAT laboratory in Harrogate, Britain, where  most of the research was conducted, was closed.
Thomas Fitzgerald, a spokesman for Brown and Williamson, told the Times:  "From the description given to us, it appears you are basing your article on  attorney-client privileged documents that were stolen by a former employee of  a law firm that worked for Brown and Williamson. Anybody who knowingly uses  stolen information is in fact contributing to an illegal act. We have no  further comment."
Brown and Williamson eventually marketed low tar and nicotine brands of  cigarettes, among them Merit, but none were as safe as Ariel, the paper  pointed out.
Another cigarette company, Liggett and Myers, also developed a safer  cigarette in research that began in 1955, but decided to shelve it, the daily  said.
Thomas Mold, retired assistant director of research at Liggett and Myers,  told the Times that his group created the safer product which was ready for  market by 1979, but he was told that executives, on the advice of lawyers,  voted not to produce it.
"We wrote up the work we had done in a paper for publication, but we were  not allowed to publish it," Mold said.

Islamic nations stand ready to provide peacekeeping  troops to defend the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina if western UN forces are  withdrawn, Pakistani ambassador Hamad Kamal said Friday.
Kamal was speaking after representatives of the 51-state Organization of  the Islamic Conference (OIC) met in urgent session in Geneva and expressed  "deep concerns" at the state of peace negotiations for Bosnia.
The Islamic gathering came as West European, US and Russian foreign  ministers also met in the city in a fresh effort to agree a workable peace,  amid threats to withdraw UN forces if no formula is found rapidly.
Kamal read an OIC statement noting "the threat of certain countries to  withdraw their peacekeeping contingents." France which has the biggest  contingent has threatened withdrawal failing a rapid solution.
The OIC statement warned against such action without analysis of its  impact on the situation on the ground and the drafting in of replacement  troops, "for which adequate offers already exist from several OIC member  states."
The Pakistani ambassador added that said while the OIC considered the  lives of UN troops in Bosnia important, "we believe that the lives of the  people in Bosnia-Hercegovina are even more important."
Kamal also said a Malaysian major killed in Bosnia Thursday had died "in  defence of the principles the OIC upholds in Bosnia."
Paying tribute to the same officer, Bosnian ambassador Mohamed Sacirbey  distinguished between countries which provided UN troops "mandated to defend  civilians under attack" and those which "mandated soldiers to remain neutral."
Sacirbey interpreted Thursday's US Senate vote calling for lifting of the  arms embargo on Bosnia as a sign of concern at the "failure to provide balance  to the military situation" and as a result influence the negotiations.
"The Bosnians do not just have friends in the Islamic world. They have  friends in the highest institutions that represent democracy in the US and the  world in general," he told the OIC press conference.
In its statement the OIC, which has called for the lifting of the embargo  on arms supplies to Bosnia, "regretted the exclusion of OIC representatives"  from the so-called "contact group" meeting on Bosnia in Geneva.
The statement reaffirmed that OIC representatives should participate on an  equal footing with those of other countries in the peace efforts.
While maintaining their offer of active participation, it said that  "continued rejection of this offer could adversely impact upon the credibility  and sustainability of any solutions worked out in their absence."
The OIC statement warned that a durable and just peace could not be  achieved without ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of   Bosnia-Hercegovina and the return of territories seized through aggression,  ethnic cleansing or genocide.

The priority of the United Nations in war-ravaged  Rwanda is to reach a ceasefire between rebels and government soldiers before  undertaking any political negotiations, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, the UN  special representative to Rwanda said here Friday.
"For now, it is difficult to resume political negotiations so long as  there is no ceasefire," Booh Booh said following a meeting with UN Secretary  General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
"A ceasefire is theoretically possible but certain conditions must be  fulfilled" first, he said referring to the Tutsi rebels' refusal to recognize  the transitional government set up following the death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana, a Hutu, who was killed in a suspicious plane crash on April 6.
Hutu killing squads embarked on a bloody rampage through Kigali after the  president's death and the rebels retaliated by sweeping through northern and  eastern Rwanda, seizing control of two-thirds of the small central African  highland nation, and pounding army positions in the capital.
Booh Booh arrived in Paris Thursday from the Rwandan capital of Kigali.

Albania's last communist president Ramiz Alia is to  face trial on May 21 for criminal abuse of office, the state prosecutor's  office said Friday.
The 67-year-old Alia, along with nine other ousted communists, will be  charged with "abuse of office with criminal consequences," including the  murder of Albanians fleeing the country, deportations, summary executions and  embezzlement of public funds.
Among others set to stand trial are former premier Adil Carcani and former  interior ministers Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai as well as ex party leaders  amd former justice and police officials.
If convicted they face up to 25 years behind bars.
Last year Nexhmije Hoxha, the 72-year-old widow of Enver Hoxha, founder  and longtime Stalinist dictator of post-war Albania, was sentnced to 11 years  in prison for embazzling state funds.

Philippine President Fidel Ramos is to make his  first visit to Europe since taking office in 1992 with a trip to France in  September to open an exhibition, a source said Friday.
He is also expected to visit other European countries to promote his  country in the business field, after opening the "San Diego" exhibition in  Paris September 13 together with his French counterpart Francois Mitterrand.
The exhibition will display the remains of the Spanish merchant ship built  in the Philippines in the 16th century, together with artifacts found with the  ship by a team of French archeologists.
The open of the ship exhibit will be the high point of a Philippine  festival which begins this month in Paris.

The dollar was boosted briefly on Friday on the  London foreign exchange market by US inflation figures that were lower than  expected, while sterling stabilized after a recent rise and gold traded in  late afternoon at 380.75 dollars an ounce against 378.5 Thursday evening.
Traders said the dollar eased later in the session after the initial  stimulus to stand in late afternoon at 1.6680 marks against 1.6730 a little  earlier in New York, and at 104.85 yen against 105.35 in London mid-session -  the latter representing its highest level against the Japanese currency since  early April.
The greenback was helped in the morning by the announcement in Tokyo of a  resumption of US-Japanese trade negotiations in Washington next week.
Midland Global Markets analyst Alison Cottrell said the dollar "firmed  after publication of the American data, then fell back, then rose again  following the bond market before once more weakening late in the day".
Despite the slight 0.1 percent monthly rise in US retail prices in April,  operators still expect a rise in US interest rates next week, the analyst  said.
The Greek drachma remained under pressure before full liberation in six  weeks of the EU capital market, and the Bank of Greek had to intervene  massively to prop up the currency, Athens forex dealers said. It closed in  London at 148.32 to the mark after finishing a little earlier in Athens at  147.70.
Due to the Ascension holiday and its extension, other European currencies  traded within narrow ranges. The Irish punt was stable at 0.4095 to a mark  after a quarter-point cut in the Irish short-term interest rate, to 6.25  percent.
The mark firmed to 3.4315 French francs against 3.4292 Thursday evening.
The dollar was trading in late afternoon at 1.6680 marks (against 1.6675  Thursday evening), 104.85 yen (104.20), 1.4260 Swiss francs (1.4262), and  5.7162 French francs (5.7188).
Sterling stood at 1.4990 dollars (1.4995), 2.5003 marks (2.5004), 157.17  yen (156.25), 2.1376 Swiss francs (2.1386), and 8.5687 French francs (8.5753).
The three-month Eurodollar was unchanged at 4.75 percent, and the British  three-month interbank rate at 5.1875 percent.

Copper soared during the week to reach its highest  point for 13 months, lifting above the 2,100-dollar-per-tonne level on  expected increased demand in Europe and the US, and significantly lower stocks.
But other metals on the London Metals Exchange (LME) moved little, except  nickel, which rose strongly after Inco unions voted to allow a strike, if  necessary, at the firm's Sudbury plant in Ontario, Canada.
The precious metals were generally higher, along with Brent crude North  Sea oil which remained above 16 dollars per barrel.
The price of coffee continued to climb, breaking through the key  1,900-dollars-per-barrel level despite some profit taking later.
Cocoa was also in better health, lifting to its highest level since the  end of March. White sugar lifted as news of mass imports by India hit the  market.
Wool reached its highest level since December 1992, after a cut in  Australian production and on stronger demand.

higher but irregular. Gold lifted above last week's prices, but  fluctuated around 380 dollars per ounce during the week.
Trading was generally calm as several markets were closed for the  Ascension holiday.
A strike by 9,500 miners in the Kloof mine in South Africa had little  impact, although the company was said to have lost 5.7 million dollars in the  space of a week.
The annual report by Golf Fields Mineral Services predicted that the world  gold market would remain active this year on a predicted rise in industrial  demand and a pick-up in interest by investors.
SILVER: higher. Prices lifted after last week's weakness, reaching 5.46  dollars per ounce, as investment funds showed renewed interest.
The metal gained after the Silver Institute, made up of producers and  consumers, reported the annual production deficit would reach 248.4 million  ounces this year -- a deficit for the fourth consecutive year.
Stocks were consequently predicted to drop to 620 million ounces compared  with 1.1 billion ounces in 1990.
PLATINUM: higher. Prices lifted after their low level last week,  fluctuating between 393 and 397 dollars per ounce.
The market was firmer after the nomination of Nelson Mandela as the first  black prime minister went off peacefully in South Africa -- the world's  premier producer.
Speculators, who had deserted the market on uncertainties surrounding the  first multi-racial general election in South Africa, appeared to regain  confidence and invest in the metal.

A Colombian drug boss was ordered released by a  judge Friday after serving two years of a 17 year sentence for drug  trafficking and illegal enrichment.
After his arrest April 27, 1992, Ivan Urdinola negotiated a reduction in  sentence to four and half years by confessing voluntarily to the charges and  turning over part of his assets.
But a judge, whose identity is secret, decided to further reduce his  sentence to 24 months, which would make Urdinola eligble for immediate release.
The Attorney General's office, seeking to prevent his leaving the country,  recently asked US authorities for evidence against Urdinola on heroine  trafficking, kidnapping for ransom, illegal enrichment and other charges.
America claims Urdinola is one of the leaders of the Valle cocaine cartel.
The Attorney General's office was holding Urdinola under a special order,  but the Procurator General's office ordered it revoked May 2 for lack of  evidence against him in several murder cases in the province of El Valle, in  western Colombia.
The newspaper El Tiempo on Friday said the judge who reduced Urdinola's  sentenced used a controversial proceedure in effect giving him the maximum  benefits allowed for under two separate laws.
One law modified and supplanted a law already on the books, but the judge  applied only those aspects of both laws that favored Urdinola, a procedure  that some jurists say is illegal.

soaring. Copper jumped a massive 192 dollars during the week,  lifting to its highest point for 13 months at 2,119 dollars per tonne at the  close on Thursday. It continued to rise Friday on encouraging stocks figures.
Dealers said the prospects of increased demand in Europe and the US,  combined with significantly lower stocks, were pushing the metal up  significantly.
"There is a lot of short covering in the market," said analyst William  Adams from Rudolf Wolff, adding that there were supply problems in central  Africa.
Other dealers said the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), formerly  the Soviet Union, was exporting less then predicted.
"Copper's rise is not particularly speculative," said Adams, adding that  many merchants had sold forward and with problems in supply were obliged to  buy on the market to fulfill their contracts.
Adams predicted the metal would continue to rise and could breakthrough  the 2,130 dollars per tonne level in the short term, with the possibility of  rising to 2,175 and 2,200 dollars per tonne soon.
The magazine Metal Bulletin said the substantial arbitrage between Comex  in New York and the London markets was still wooing red metal across the  Atlantic, and was subsequently forcing up premiums in Europe, where --  particularly in Germany and France -- demand is starting to take off again.
On Friday, the red metal broke through its highest point since early July  1993, when records on the LME changed to measuring in dollars per tonne  instead of pounds per tonne.
Elsewhere, the market's perception of underlying tightness in the physical  copper market appeared to be borne out by confirmation by Italian  semi-fabricator Metalrame that its output of copper rod was down by 3,000  tonnes so far this year due to problems sourcing refined copper feed.
Weekly stocks on the LME fell a staggering 31,725 tonnes to 424,700 tonnes.
LEAD: slightly lower. Lead moved little throughout the week, sinking  around five dollars from the previous Friday close at 484.5 dollars per tonne.
The Economist Intelligence Unit said the lead market was generally better  oriented in 1994, compared to previous years with a rise in consumption and a  deficit of production of around 160,000 tonnes.
Weekly stocks on the LME rose 2,725 tonnes to a record 345,725 tonnes.
---
slightly lower. Zinc fell around the same levels as lead, dipping  five dollars during the week from the previous Friday close of 977 dollars per  tonne.
Traders at GNI said current prices were at the top of their expectations  and predicted zinc could fall further in the short term.
Weekly zinc stocks on the LME rose 8,590 tonnes to a record 1,157,350  tonnes.
---
stable. Aluminium dropped around three dollars during the week  from the previous Friday close of 1,332 dollars per tonne.
Aluminium moved little during the week, largely on lack of news and as the  record rise of copper scooped dealers attention.
The US Aluminium Industry repored a 14 percent fall in US primary  aluminium output in April to 269,450 tonnes from 313.250 tonnes a year ago. On  an annualised basis this is an output cut of 525,600 tonnes.
It was also reported that Alcan had taken delivery of the first Aluminium  Intensive Vehicle AIV, jointly developed by the firm and Ford for consumer  testing.
The vehicle is said to be identical to the normal steelbodied Sable, but  weighs 400 lbs less as a result of the extensive use of aluminium in the  structure and exterior panels.
Stocks on the LME rose a further 17,625 tonnes to a record 2,646,675  tonnes.
NICKEL: sharply higher. Nickel soared higher to a three month high since  February 24, lifting 165 dollars over the week to the Thursday close of 5,940  dollars per tonne.
During the day on Thursday, the metal soared a massive 115 dollars on  expectations that workers at Canadian producer Inco's Sudbury, Ontario  division, would vote later to give their union a strike mandate in current  labour labour talks.
This mandate was granted late Thursday, local time in Canada, with a total  of 93.5 percent of voting members in favour of authorising the union to take  strike action if it is deemed necessary.
The current labor contract at Sudbury is set to expire at the end of this  month. The market believes Inco has only enough stocks to continue nickel  deliveries for three weeks in the event of industrial action.
The Sudbury divison produces an average of approximately 20 million pounds  of refined nickel per month. It is producing less this month because one of  the division's two flash furnaces broke down last Friday, also lifting prices.
The company then said it would replace the furnace within a week, and that  the incident would not have any significant impact on its 1994 production  targets.
Weekly stocks on the LME fell 432 tonnes to 132,516 tonnes.
TIN: lower. Tin fell around 60 dollars during the week, from the previous  Friday close of 5,505 dollars per tonne.
---
The member nations of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC)  exported a total of 14,258 tonnes of tin from January to March -- a volume  26.9 percent below the permitted export tonnage, the association said.
A Bolivian delegate to the ATPC told a meeting of the association that  global tin stocks were "slightly high" but should "fall slightly" later this  year.
The ATPC, which groups the world's major tin producers, is limiting supply  in a bid to trim global stocks.
In 1993, the ATPC said member nations exported 72,469 tonnes of tin, below  the agreed limit of 89,000 tonnes. In ATPC produced 73,268 tonnes of tin in  1993, below the agreed limit of 92,387 tonnes.
China's (new) membership in the association should cause stocks to drop as  that nation "will now effectively comply with the quota put by the ATPC," said  Gonzalo Alvarez.
Elsewhere, the Malyan Mining Employers Association, which groups  Malaysia's main tin mining and smelting companies, said it was considering  disbanding because of the dramatic decline in the country's tin industry.
Weekly stocks on the LME rose 945 tonnes to a record 27,905 tonnes.

higher. After a mixed beginning, prices lifted sharply on Thursday  to around 995 pounds per tonne at the close -- their highest level since the  end of March.
Dealers said the return of investment funds into the market boosted  prices, which had fallen over the past few weeks on temporary lack of interest.
Lawrence Eagle, analyst at GNI trade house, said the cocoa market appeared  fundamentally strong.
The International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) said it predicted a production  deficit of 95,000 tonnes for 1993-1994 (October-September).
Eagle said that after coffee and copper, cocoa would be the next market to  see sharp rises.
Elsewhere, Indonesia, which is one of the key world producers, rejected  invitations from ICCO to rejoin the organisation. The question will be  examined again in June at the next meeting of the ICCO.
COFFEE: sharp rises then technical fall. The price of robusta lifted above  1,900 dollars per tonne on Tuesday, its highest level for five years.
The extremely high prices for delivery in May and June were due to a  severe restriction in the supply of robusta and the short-term availability of  Colombian coffee.
Large-scale buying by investment funds on the London and New York markets  magnified the swift rise in prices, dealers said.
From Wednesday onwards, prices began to fall as speculators took profits,  but then rose again on Friday.
Investors' confidence was not dented by the fact that the Association of  Coffee Producing Countries (APPC) could henceforth sell some 50 percent of  their stocks accumulated in the agreed export retention plan.
The calculated index which fixes the level of retention has lifted above a  certain level and exporters can sell around 2 million sacks (each of 60  kilogrammes).
Brazilian exporters immediately announced the sale, from Wednesday, of  118,700 of the 650,000 sacks of coffee stocked since October 1, 1993 in the  retention plan.

sharply higher. The price of white sugar jumped above 320 dollars  per tonne after India announced it would import at least 500,000 tonnes of  sugar to cover its production deficit. India is the world's premier producer  and consumer.
The Indian government said that 112,000 tonnes of sugar should be  delivered to Indian refinaries between now and mid-May to stop prices internal  prices rises as the shortage hits the market.
Elsewhere, the world production was an estimated four percent higher at  116.3 million tonnes in 1994/95 (September-August) from 112.2 million tonnes  in the previous season.
South African production, which has suffered from drought, is expected to  fall to 1.6 million tonnes in 1994/95 (April-March), leaving only 200,000  tonnes for export.
VEGETABLE OILS: higher. The falls during the previous week were only  temporary and the majority of vegetable oils lifted higher on the Rotterdam  market in subdued trading due to the Ascension holiday.
Soya prices lifted, while the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)  predicted a 16.11 percent rise in US production in 1994-1995  (October-September) after a fall in 1993-1994 harvests on account of bad  weather.
The price of palm oil continued to lift on strong demand, as did sunflower  and rapeseed oil.
The journal Oil World predicted a 7.6 percent rise to 238.62 million  tonnes next year in the harvest of the seeds and fruits needed to make the 10  main vegetable oils.
Demand was also estimated to reach 235.87 million tonnes while stocks  should end the season at 27.60 million tonnes from 24.85 at the end of the  current season.

steady, then higher. After breaking through the 16-dollars-per-barrel  level last week for the first time since November 1993, the price of Brent  crude North Sea flucutated in technical trading before rising towards the end  of the week.
Figures from the American Petroleum Instutite (API) pushed prices slightly  lower during the week, as they showed US stocks had lifted 4.72 million  barrels last week compared with the previous week, while domestic fuel and  gas-oil had lifted 1.39 million barrels.
A rise in US reserves on the NYMEX on Thursday, however, lifted prices  again above the 16-dollars-per-tonne mark.
Civil war in Yemen, which was responsible for price rises two weeks ago,  continued to fuel fears of a cut in production from the country which produces  350,000 barrels per day.
RUBBER: higher. Prices continued to rise, reaching 720 pounds per tonne on  a cut in world production and a rise in demand.
The International Rubber Study Group said the surplus in production would  only be around 10,000 tonnes in 1993, compared with 120,000 tonnes the  previous year.
World produciton is estimated to be around 5.43 million tonnes in 1993,  compared to 5.6 million tonnes in 1992, while consumption is expected to be  5.42 million tonnes from 5.48 million tonnes.
The production of the world's three premier producers, Thailand, Indonesia  and Malaysia, has dropped respectively 1.5 million tonnes, 1.353 million  tonnes and 1.074 million tonnes.
---
lower. The price of wheat fell steadily lower, dropping over four  dollars to finish the week at around 113 pounds per tonne after the US refused  to sell Russia 400,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat.
Prices were also lower on expectations of a strong US winter wheat harvest.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicted a 9.34 percent cut in  wheat production from the former Soviet Union to 76.3 million tonnes in  1994-1995. Imports were estimated to fall to 13.5 million tonnes from 14.02  million tonnes in 1993-1994.
The price of barley remained stable at around 109 pounds per tonne,  although European markets were calm on account of the Ascension holiday.
TEA: stable. The average auction price of tea remained stable at around  127 pence per kilo, although demand was described as reasonably good.
The price of high quality tea from Africa rose on the continued civil  conflict in Rwanda, leading dealers to fear the worst for production from the  country.
The auction price for African medium quality tea dipped four pence to  eight pence. Teas from Celon followed the same trend.
COTTON: slightly lower. Prices suffered from a lack of activity and  slipped through the barrier at 0.86 dollars per pound, as the Ascension  holiday weighed on the market.
Austria and Switzerland were the main buyers during the week, while cotton  from central Asia was the most in demand.
WOOL: higher. The reference price of Australian wool on the Bradford  market was higher, reaching above 4.22 pounds per kilo, on firm demand and a  cut in Australian production.
Recent statistics show that exports from New Zealand, which is the world's  second producer after Australia, lifted above production during the first nine  months in the 1993-1994 season (July-June), resulting in a cut in stocks.
Production rose 13 percent, while exports lifted 21 percent, totalling 760  million dollars for the period.
New Zealand wool stocks, created after a slump in prices in 1991, should  be used up by the end of the next season, analysts said.

West European, Russian and US foreign ministers  held extensive talks in Geneva on Friday in a fresh effort to agree a workable  peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina and end the war in the former Yugoslav  republic.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd, French Foreign Minister Alan Juppe, German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel and the Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, as well  as their Belgian and Greek counterparts and a European Union representative.
The talks, originally expected to last some four hours, continued into  Friday evening.
After two years of destruction and division leaving tens of thousands of  people dead, wounded or displaced, frustration at the failure of previous  peace proposals marked the run-up to this high-level encounter.
France and its west European partners were set on wresting agreement on a  ceasefire and political settlement formula.
Juppe, whose country has furnished the largest contingent for United  Nations forces in Bosnia, has warned that the UN forces will not weather  another winter there without such a plan.
But the administration of US President Bill Clinton has been reluctant to  see an existing European settlement plan imposed on the Moslem-led government  in Sarajevo.
The US Senate also narrowly voted Thursday to unilaterally lift the arms  embargo on Bosnia, in a move to bolster the Moslem forces against the  Belgrade-backed Serb forces who have carved out their own  "ethnically-cleansed" territory in the republic.
The lower Russian house of parliament for its part voted Friday to no  longer adhere to the UN sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia of Serbia and  its tiny Montenegrin ally.
Friday's Duma resolution stipulated that in the event of a "unilateral  lifting by a state of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia," Russia would  have to respond with "adequate measures that could go as far as raising the  question of a unilateral exit from the sanctions regime."
Neither vote can take immediate or binding effect. Observers regarded them  rather as straws in the wind expressing exasperation over the Bosnian conflict  and underlining the growing pressure to come up with a solution.
The Geneva meeting was expected to issue a declaration calling for a new  ceasefire and reaffirming the desired principles of a political settlement.
But there have been continuing problems over the division of territory to  be apportioned to the warring parties.
An existing European plan gives 51 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina to the  Croats and Moslems, and 49 percent for the Serbs, who through their war-gains  currently control about 70 percent.
The Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who under US auspices have separately  reached agreement to set up a federation within the former Yugoslav republic,  have demanded 58 percent for this federation.
Bosnia's vice-president Ejup Ganic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic were  scheduled to finalise the federation plan in Geneva Saturday with Christopher  and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic.
The whole Bosnian question is also expected to come up again at a meeting  in Brussels Monday of EU foreign ministers.
Earlier, Pakistani ambassador Hamad Kamal said here that Islamic nations  stood ready to provide peacekeeping troops to defend the people of  Bosnia-Hercegovina if western UN forces were withdrawn.
He spoke after representatives of the 51-state Organization of the Islamic  Conference (OIC) met in urgent session in Geneva and expressed "deep concerns"  at the state of peace negotiations for Bosnia.
The OIC noted threats by some countries to withdraw their forces but  warned against such action without analysis of its impact on the situation on  the ground and the drafting in of replacement troops, "for which adequate  offers already exist from several OIC member states."

Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has  refused ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's request that his  Liberal Democratic Party be part of the cabinet, Interfax reported Friday.
The agency, citing a well-informed government source, said Chernomyrdin  held a 20-minute meeting Thursday with Zhirinovsky, who suggested his party be  given the defense and interior portfolios, or the justice portfolio which  includes the post of prosecutor general, or the ministries of economy and  privatisation.
Chernomyrdin reportedly rejected Zhirinovsky's "demands" telling him the  cabinet was not set up on the basis of political representation but rather on  the basis of "professional ability," Interfax said.

The Italian cabinet Friday chose 37 undersecretaries  of state, 12 of them neo-fascists.
The previous governmment had 39 undersecretaries of state.
The list means that the neo-fascist National Alliance has either a  minister or an undersecretary in each ministry.
Thirteen of the new posts went to members of Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi's Forza Italia, 10 to the federalist Northern League and two to the  Democratic-Christian Centre.

Members of the UN Security Council  intensified discussions Friday on plans to send 5,500 soldiers to Rwanda as  part of a UN humanitarian mission, diplomats said.
The rotating president of the council, Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria, said a  resolution could be approved later in the day.
The proposed reinforcement of the UN Mission to aid Rwanda, which was  reduced to only 270 members last month, followed recommendations by UN  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
He sought a review of the UN mandate to respond to the humantiarian  emergency in Rwanda, which has been plunged into chaos by bloody ethnic  fighting that erupted following the death of Rwanda's president Juvenal  Habyarimana April 6 in a suspicious plane crash.
A working group composed of several Security Council members met Friday  morning to draft a resolution which was to be considered in consultations with  the full council several hours later.
Several points of the draft must still be discussed, notably a reference  to the notion of "genocide" in Rwanda and possible international trials of  people accused of atrocities, diplomats said.
Another point was the possibility that the UN peacekeepers could resort to  force to protect civilians in so-called humanitarian securty zones, they said.
The Security Council also was expected to impose an arms embargo on  Rwanda, where an estimated 200,000 people have been killed in the fighting.
Earlier on Friday in Paris, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, the UN special  representative to Rwanda said the UN priority was to reach a ceasefire between  rebels and government soldiers before undertaking any political negotiations.
"For now, it is difficult to resume political negotiations so long as  there is no ceasefire," Booh Booh said following a meeting with UN Secretary  General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
"A ceasefire is theoretically possible but certain conditions must be  fulfilled" first, he said referring to the Tutsi rebels' refusal to recognize  the transitional government set up following the death of Habyarimana.

North Korea is willing to hold talks with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to try and narrow differences  between the two on the replacement of fuel rods at a controversial nuclear  plant, the IAEA announced Friday.
The agency said that the date and location of the "working-level  discussions" had not been decided. The North Korean decision was in response  to an invitation by the IAEA.
Meanwhile a team of IAEA inspectors are to head to North Korea this  weekend to inspect various nuclear facilities there, IAEA spokesman David Kyd  said earlier.
The inspectors will visit the nuclear plant at Yongbyon, but will not be  allowed access to the plant's five megawatt reactor, which the United States  suspects is being used to produce nuclear weapons.
In March an IAEA team was denied access to the same reactor, from which it  hoped to collect spent fuel rod samples to determine whether any were being  diverted for military purposes.
Kyd said that the upcoming trip would last eight days although it could be  extended if necessary.
He said that although the inspectors would not be allowed to accomplish  their full mission "they will be able to do most of their work, which is  satisfactory for us."

Kantor
(INSERTS background)
WASHINGTON, May 13 (AFP) - US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he  had agreed Friday with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need for  preliminary contacts to resume bilateral trade talks.
The so-called framework agreement negotiations collapsed last February  because of a dispute over how to measure progress in opening Japan's market  and reducing its 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.
In Tokyo, officials said Kakizawa had agreed to resume the stalled  framework talks, but Kantor's statement spoke only of preliminary contacts.
"Ambassador Kantor agreed with the suggestion of Foreign Minister Kakizawa  on the need for preliminary contact between both sides to explore the basis  for resumption of the framework talks," the statement said.
"They both shared the hope that a basis will emerge for the resumption of  the framework talks before the July G7 meeting in Naples," it said.
Kakizawa called Kantor and they discussed the issue for 30 minutes, the  statement said.
The trade talks were suspended in February after Japan refused to accept  the principle of numerical targets to measure progress in opening its market  to foreign goods and services.
On Wednesday, Kantor said the United States was receptive to resuming the  talks, but that the first move was up to Japan.
A spokesman for Kantor also denied knowledge of a possible visit to  Washington next week of two high-level Japanese officials -- Sozaburo  Okamatsu, vice minister of international affairs at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI), and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy minister  of economic affairs -- to try to end the impasse.
Their visit was announced early Friday in Tokyo by Japanese Trade Minister  Eijiro Hata.
One problem in the bilateral trade dispute is that President Bill Clinton  has had to deal with three different Japanese prime ministers in less than a  year.
Clinton reached a so-called framework agreement with then-Japanese prime  minister Kiichi Miyazawa in July under which Washington was to take steps to  control its economy, notably by reducing its budget deficit.
In return Japan would take steps to open its markets in four key areas:  automobiles and auto parts, medical equipment, insurance and  telecommunications.
The July 1993 accord gave the two sides six months to work out key  details, notably how they were to measure progress in opening Japan's markets.
By the time the six months was up in February, Miyazawa had fallen, to be  replaced by the pro-reform Morihiro Hosokawa.
But the new Japanese administration refused to accept the US call for  numerical targets to measure progress, saying this smacked of managed trade  and quotas.
Hosokawa resigned on April 8 and was replaced by Tsutomu Hata in late  April.
Washington meanwhile has held firm to its insistence that the "objective  criteria" enshrined in the original framework accord meant concrete measures  of progress, and that had to include numbers in some form.
Kantor said Tuesday that while problems remained over the framework  agreement, there had been "great strides" in other areas of the trade  relationship with Japan in recent months.
He cited Japan's agreement to accept imported rice, an accord giving US  company Motorola better access to the Japanese cellular telephone market and  an agreement on copper.
Since the breakdown of the trade talks the United States has re-instituted  Super 301, a trade law allowing it to impose unilateral sanctions on countries  it considers guilty of unfair trade practices.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Friday  hailed the "historic step toward a new Middle East peace" born of recent  Israeli-Palestinian accords.
"It's a solid track, a one-way track, and I don't think there can be a  going back on what was achieved," he told the Royal Institute of International  Affairs before leaving for a meeting with US counterpart Warren Christopher in  Geneva.
Moussa said he was optimistic that "Arab-Israeli peace seems to be  attainable," that there was "a possibility to reach a settlement that would  give both Arabs and Israelis a sense of security."
The future of the Middle East would be determined, he said, by four  factors: Israel's withdrawal from territory it occupied after the 1967 war,  guarantees of security for all sides, normalized relations between Israel and  Arab nations, and political rights for the Palestinians.
"If we can really achieve that, then the prospects for the Middle East are  there," he said. "The Israelis have started to feel cohabitation is possible.  On the Arab side, Israel is no longer the enemy."
The Israeli-Palestinian accords on Gaza and Jericho were only "a first  step," said Moussa. "The second would be autonomy in the totality of the West  Bank."
He cautioned against over-optimism, and "exaggeration in the demands of  this or that side.
"Security must be for both sides," he said. "They have to prove they are  able to live together side by side as neighbors."

Britain must play its full part in  Europe and adopt free market policies or fall behind the United States, Japan  and China in the 21st century, Prime Minister John Major said Friday.
He told a Conservative Party meeting here the issue of Europe ran deep in  British politics and "raised concerns and fears that are too often played on  too readily."
"For too long Europe has been the poison in the well of British politics,"  said Major, adding that too many people had presented the debate in  fundamentalist terms, "a little Eurosceptic or a little Europhile.
"This approach misses the real debate," he said. "The real debate must be  about how we can make Europe a success, how to make sure it raises enthusiasm,  not resentment, how to make sure it raises the quality of our life and is not  seen as threatening the nature of our life.
"Europe is absolutely fundamental to this country's national interest,"  said Major. "We cannot turn our backs on that. It would be the ultimate  abdication, a supreme folly."
He offered a vision of a wider, more open, "people's Europe," that would  tackle the concerns of ordinary people and did not seek to interfere where it  was not needed.
Major, who had recast his speech to remove political aspects in the wake  of the sudden death Thursday of opposition Labour Party leader John Smith,  renewed his tribute to Smith.
"We can weep for a good man - even an opponent - because we recognise his  qualities," he said.
Despite "artificial confrontations" twice a week in the Commons question  time with the Labour leader, Major said, he liked Smith.
Their often bitter political confrontations, he said, concealed  "friendship, decency, respect and understanding that existed behind the scenes  in politics."

Steffi Graf stumbled into the semi-finals of the  German Open on Friday, dropping a set to Julie Halard, but returning after a  rain break to win 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.
It was a miserable performance from the top seed, who mixed flashes of  brilliance with masses of unforced errors. Typical of her erratic play, she  dropped the 2nd set with a double fault.
Although unable to find any consistency, Graf took the first set after  breaking to lead 5-4, hitting a fine backhand down the line on set point.
But France's Halard refused to be disheartened, and claimed the second set  6-4, before Graf clinched a close match in the final set on a Halard netted  service return.
Graf said afterwards: "She played incredibly well. She just went for shots  that were unbelievable, so I tried to hang in there. She took so many risks  and everything she hit, she hit very well, especially her forehand."
Anke Huber abruptly ended the run of Russia's Elena Makarova in the  quarter-finals, winning 6-0, 6-1 in just under an hour. It was one of the  German's finest performances for some time, and she pressured her opponent  form beginning to end.
Makarova said afterwards: "I was really tired and couldn't keep my  concentration, and she was playing so fast. If I put the ball short, she hit  it so hard."

Chinese dissident Chen Ziming, one of the  leading figures during the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was released from  prison Friday to receive medical treatment, the official Xinhua news agency  reported.
Chen, a 40-year-old economist and publisher of the reformist Economic  Weekly, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in February 1991 for "conspiring to  subvert the government and "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement."
Chen's release follows that of five Christians from re-education camps, as  well as the release of two other dissidents on Thursday, in what appears to be  moves to persuade US President Bill Clinton to extend China's  most-favored-nation trade status.
Chen "has been released on bail for medical treatment today with the  permission of the Chinese judicial authorities," Xinhua said, monitored here.
The sentence handed down on Chen was one of the heaviest for any leader of  the 1989 movement which culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4.
Chen, who came from the eastern province of Zhejiang, was director of the  private Beijing Social-Economic Research Institute as well as a contributor to  the Economic Weekly.
During his period of detention in Qincheng prison, Chen had secretly  written a book on the history of China since the launching of reforms by  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978. The manuscript was smuggled out of the  prison and published in Hong Kong.
Chen was eighth on the "most-wanted criminals" list issued by the public  security ministry in 1989. The six poeple who headed the list either managed  to flee China or were allowed to leave by the authorities, such as  astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian.

Emerson Fittipaldi wants Formula One  to adopt some Indy car safety measures so his friend Ayrton Senna will not  have died in vain.
In the wake of three tragic Formula One crashes, the reigning Indianapolis  500 champion from Brazil considers himself safer here at top speeds of 245 mph  (392 km/h) than on much slower Formula One courses.
"The Formula One (safety) rules are not as good as Indy car," Fittipaldi  said. "Our chassis is higher and gives much better protection to the driver's  head. In F1, the driver's shoulders are just sticking out. The helmet is the  only protection. There's not enough material on the side if you're hit there."
Fittipaldi, the 1972 and 1974 F1 world driving champion, also wants  stronger car bodies. He hopes future drivers might survive crashes similar to  those which killed Senna and Austria's Roland Ratzenberger and Thursday's  mishap that left Austria's Karl Wendlinger in a deep coma.
"In F1, they need to increase the minimum weight of the cars, which (at  1,350 pounds) is 250 pounds less than Indy cars. They really look fragile,"  Fittipaldi said. "That's the main problem in my opinion."
Wendlinger's crash brought concern from drivers practicing for Saturday's  pole qualifying for the May 29 Indy race. Contenders on the 2.5-mile (4km)  oval average more than 227 mph (363 km/h), but have greater aerodynamics for  better handling at top speed.

"I really don't want to believe it has happened," said Nigel Mansell, the  1992 F1 champion. "The situation is dire, not just for Formula One but  motorsports."
Mario Andretti, the 1978 F1 champion, wants track safety studied as well  as greater cockpit protection.
"We should learn something from these tragic accidents," Andretti said.  "When it comes to safety, measures should be redundant. What would it cost for  an extra wall of tires? The other thing is F1 cockpits are much more naked.  The driver's whole neck is exposed. Padding would help with side impact."
"Either of these things might have saved Senna and Ratzenberger," he said.
Fittipaldi stressed that drivers and race organizers must work together to  correct the problems.
"They should sit down around the same table and everyone should give input  on the future of racing. That would be constructive," said Fittipaldi, who  called the week of Senna's funeral one of the toughest in his career.
Scotland's Derrick Walker, an Indy-car team owner and manager, pointed out  that Indy's safety measures came after past tragedies.
"This place has had some crashes and learned from them," Walker said. "All  groups must pick their safety level and look ahead so we don't lose our top  racers, so we don't have the tragedies you see over there now."

The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries ended a meeting on Bosnia-Hercegovina  Friday with a call for a ceasefire, and negotiations between the warring  parties in two weeks, a French diplomatic source reported.
He said the ministers had called for the ceasefire to be "unconditional."
A communique due to be published later in the evening would reiterate the  ministers' support for a European Union proposal to divide the former Yugoslav  republic on the basis of 51 percent for Moslems and Croats and 49 percent for  Serbs, the source said.

Stocks were firm on the Frankfurt exchange this  week, strengthened by positive first quarter results from a number of  companies and a lowering of key interest rates on Wednesday.
The DAX index of 30 leading stocks closed Friday at 2,258.75 points, up  0.97 percent for the week after a O.38 percent dip on Monday which echoed  losses on Wall Street.
Commerzbank said turbulence on the bond market was not affecting stock  prices, and this proved investors were taking more account of economic  conditions and company forecasts.
The bank is predicting an average increase of 25 percent in net profits  next year despite a new solidarity tax to help cover the cost of reunification  which is due to come into effect in 1995.
Among major companies, Degussa posted a rise of 25.50 German marks to  540.50 marks, and Deutsche Bank rose 5.70 marks to 364.50 marks.
Volkswagen gained 5.50 marks to 528.50, and BMW rose 10.50 to 939 marks.
Metallgesellschaft bounded up 61 marks after a buy recommendation Friday  by Swiss banks.
The yield on the 10-year six percent bond was at 6.44 percent Friday  compared with 6.61 percent a week previously.

England's Philip Don is replacing Holland's  threatened referee John Blankenstein for the European Champions Cup final  between AC Milan and Barcelona on May 18, UEFA said Friday.
Blankenstein has received death threats from Italy, as Barcelona coach  Johan Cruyff and defender Ronald Koeman are also from Holland.
European football's governing body UEFA said in a statement it: "Had  received recently a number of serious death threats from Italy." The statement  further said they were acting for reasons of security and the decision in no  way questioned Blankenstein's refereeing ability.
Vice-President of Barcelona, Jose Mussons, said: "This is not the first  time it has happened and, if it removes suspicion, so much the better."

The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries ended a meeting on Bosnia-Hercegovina  Friday with a call for a ceasefire, and negotiations between the warring  parties in two weeks, a French diplomatic source reported.
He said the ministers had called for the ceasefire to be "unconditional."
A communique due to be published later in the evening would express the  ministers' support for a European Union proposal to divide the former Yugoslav  republic on the basis of 51 percent for a federation of Moslems and Croats,  and 49 percent for Serbs, the source said.
The ministers from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France,  Belgium and Greece also proposed a phased suspension of UN sanctions against  the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) if a peace agreement was reached  and accompanied by a withdrawal of forces to agreed lines, the source added.

A group of Norwegian tourists were held up  and robbed at gunpoint here Friday only minutes after their plane touched  down, said police.
The five Norwegians were onboard a hotel shuttle bus when one of two young  men who had joined them, pulled out a gun and demanded cash and jewelery.
Police say one tourist was hit and injured during the raid.
The two men fled after ordering the driver to pull-off the expressway and  stop.

Rwandan rebels said Friday that they have taken  control half of the country after five weeks of heavy fighting with government  forces during which tens of thousands of people have died.
Fighters of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) said in a radio broadcast  monitored here by the BBC that the districts of Byumba, half of Ruhengeri in  the north, Kibungu in the east and a large part of the capital, Kigali had  fallen to rebel forces.
"In short, the RPF largely controls more than half of Rwandan territory,"  the rebel Radio Muhabura said.
RPF guerrillas on Friday captured Gako, a camp previously occupied by  government troops in the Bugesera region, about 30 kilometres (26 miles) south  of Kigali, the radio added.
In a separate report, the radio said RPF officials had been meeting  President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to discuss a ceasefire document signed by  the interim Rwandan government. It gave no details.
Rebel officials refused to endorse the proposed ceasefire because it was  signed by army officers on behalf of the government, which the RPF does not  recognize, the radio said.
"The RPF has always rejected any talks with the illegitimate government in  Rwanda but the front has always invited the Rwandese government forces for  talks aimed at stopping the military hostilities between the two sides," the  radio added.
Rwanda plunged back into civil war pitting the RPF, drawn mainly from the  Tutsi minority, against the Hutu-dominated army and pro-government militias  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in suspicious plane crash  on April 6.
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, Tutsis and Hutus, have fled into  neighbouring countries to escape the bloodbath, in what aid agencies say is  one of the biggest refugees exodus they have faced.

The dollar remained firmed against other major  currencies in quiet trading here early Friday after the government reported an  unexpectedly small rise in April consumer prices and because of a long holiday  weekend in Europe.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 381.10 dollars an ounce, up 1.20 dollars from  late Thursday.
At about 12:55 a.m. (1655 GMT), the greenback traded at 1.6695 German  marks, up from 1.6675 late Thursday.
The US currency also firmed against other major European currencies,  rising to 5.7256 French francs from 5.7200 late Thursday, 1.4255 Swiss francs  (1.4245). Against the pound sterling it remained unmoved at 0.6669.
A trader with a major European bank in New York predicted the dollar would  move between 1.6710 and 1.6720 marks for the rest of the day.
Traders were cautiously awaiting the Federal Reserve's next meeting of its  policy-setting Open Market Committee, on Tuesday. Analysts expect the Fed will  raise the federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight interbank  loans.

The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries called Friday for a four-month ceasefire  in Bosnia-Hercegovina and negotiations between the warring parties in two  weeks.
A communique issued at the end of their five-hour meeting called for a  peace agreement based on a European Union proposal to divide the former  Yugoslav republic on the basis of 51 percent for a federation of Moslems and  Croats, and 49 percent for Serbs.
The ministers from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France,  Belgium and Greece also condemned recent Serb attacks against Gorazde, a  Moslem enclave in the east which the United Nations had declared a "safe area."

The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries called Friday for a four-month ceasefire  in Bosnia-Hercegovina and negotiations between the warring parties in two  weeks.
A communique issued at the end of their five-hour meeting called for a  peace agreement based on a European Union proposal to divide the former  Yugoslav republic on the basis of 51 percent for a federation of Moslems and  Croats, and 49 percent for Serbs.
The ministers from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France,  Belgium and Greece also condemned recent Serb attacks against Gorazde, a  Moslem enclave in the east which the United Nations had declared a "safe area."
After two years of destruction and division leaving tens of thousands of  people dead, wounded or displaced, frustration at the failure of previous  peace proposals marked the run-up to this high-level encounter.
France and its west European partners were set on wresting agreement on a  ceasefire and political settlement formula.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, whose country has furnished the  largest contingent for UN forces in Bosnia, warned earlier that the UN forces  would not weather another winter there without such a plan.
The lower Russian house of parliament for its part voted Friday to no  longer adhere to the UN sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia of Serbia and  its tiny Montenegrin ally.
Friday's Duma resolution stipulated that in the event of a "unilateral  lifting by a state of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia," Russia would  have to respond with "adequate measures that could go as far as raising the  question of a unilateral exit from the sanctions regime."

Washington's credibility will be badly damaged  if it backs down in the next three weeks in its insistence that China improve  its human rights record to preserve the trade relationship, according to a  report published here Friday.
"US interests are dependent on Washington's credibility, and nobody can  doubt that a major about face on this issue before June 1994 would damage our  credibility, with negative consequences in the future," said the report from a  panel of experts sent to President Bill Clinton.
But in the longer term the panel, set up by the private Council on Foreign  Relations and chaired by former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and  Cyrus Vance, urged Clinton to abandon the link between trade and human rights.
"The goals remain important, but this particular policy tool will not  after this year provide the most effective means for pursuing the objective of  bringing China more into acord with generally-accepted international standards  on human rights," the report said.
Clinton has said he will not renew China's most favored nation (MFN)  trading status beyond June 3 unless Beijing shows significant overall progress  on human rights.
The panel urged Clinton to "shift the initiative to the more  forward-looking leaders in Beijing" in the run-up to June 3 in a bid to reach  a solution.
"This requires, we believe, extensive focus on quiet diplomacy and a  potential promise (to Beijing) that successful compliance with human rights  conditions this time will remove conditionality on MFN renewal henceforth."
In the longer term, Washington must develop a balanced relationship with  China in which human rights remained an important concern but where ties had  been normalised so that failures in one realm would not undermine the whole  relationship, added the report.
It noted that China's leaders "bridle and become more obstinate when they  feel they are being treated with contempt," but were more flexible if treated  with respect "but also firmly and convincingly told where the line is drawn."

In promoting human rights, it urged Washington to set up a bilateral human  rights commission which would meet regullarly, and to work with the  international community in drafting a multilateral response "when there are  egregious human rights violations."
"The above efforts seek to strengthen positive changes already under way  in China while avoiding activities that place America on the wrong side of  Chinese nationalism and of Chinese reform," the panel said.

Despite broad opposition here to a military  solution in Haiti, rumors of a US military intervention are growing, fueled by  the defiance of the Haitian military and domestic politics.
After denying a Los Angeles Times story Wednesday that Washington had  decided to use force and that only the timing remained in question, the White  House Friday played down the importance of military exercises in the Caribbean.
According to the Boston Globe, the exercise was devised as a trial run for  an invasion of Haiti.
President Bill Clinton is the source of the sabre rattling, having raised  the threat of military intervention several times this month in his bid to win  the reinstatement of deposed president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Skeptical of the muscle-flexing by Washington, which runs contrary to  Clinton's record, the Haitian military has decided to defy the United States  by swearing-in a provisional president, Emile Jonassaint.
In fact, all the opinion polls show that a large majority of Americans  oppose military intervention in Haiti. The Congress also is in no mood for  another foreign adventure.
Clinton also has been apprised of the international community's opposition  to the military option. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told him Thursday  not to count on France taking part in such an action to oust General Raoul  Cedras.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali made the same point May 4 in a  report to the general assembly calling for a political compromise that could  result in a Haitian solution to the crisis.
Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, made clear his opposition to the  military solution.
"I don't think we ought to put one single soldier on the ground in Haiti,"  he said in a speech Thursday in Massachusetts.
The possibility that the administration will resort to force is being  taken seriously by some, as evidenced by a New York Times editorial urging  Clinton to "stay calm on Haiti."
Thomas Carother, a specialist on Latin America and the Caribbean at the  Carnegie Foundation for International Peace, considers military intervention  "possible, and even likely" within six months for two reasons.
The first, he told AFP, has to do with the situation in Florida, where a  new wave of boat people is feared because of Clinton's recent decision to ease  his policy of immediately repatriating refugees intercepted on the high seas.
It is no coincidence that many of those calling for military action are  members of Congress from Florida.
---
Carothers stresses that for the White House Haiti is really a domestic  problem. "Florida has become an obsession of the Clinton team. They want to  win Florida in '96. It was very close in '92," he said.
With 27 electoral votes, or one-tenth the number required to win the White  House, Florida is the most important electoral prize after California. Clinton  lost it by two percent of the vote in the past presidential elections.
"The second factor is simply the sense of powerlessness and humiliation of  being defeating by these people," Carothers said.
"There is a general sense of frustration," he said, likening Clinton's  predicament to that faced by Bush in his standoff with Panama's general Manuel  Noriega.
Bush ordered US troops into Panama in December 1989. "It's hard to know  when a president reaches the breaking point," he said.
According to Carothers, the Pentagon and the State Department oppose  intervention, but the White House takes a different view.
"This is the division: between the professionals and those who think in  political terms," he said.
In his view considerations of domestic politics will carry greater weight  in the president's decision to use force than will the objections of Latin  American coutries leery of a big stick approach by Washington.

Ayrton Senna was killed by a piece of suspension  from his Williams-Renault at the San Marino grand prix, FIA president Max  Mosley said here on Friday.
"We have received the results of Senna's autopsy which allows us now to  say it was a piece of suspension, which pierced his helmet and gave the fatal  blow," said Mosley.
Brazil's three-times Formula One world champion was killed with massive  head injuries after an accident on the seventh lap of the May 1 race.

French Transport Minister Bernard  Bosson on Friday threw down the gauntlet to British airlines planning to break  the French stranglehold on flights into Paris' Orly airport next week.
British Airways, Air UK and TAT airlines say they will ignore France's  refusal to allow them to use the busy international airport south of Paris and  will launch services between London and Orly on Monday, as permitted by a  European Commission ruling.
But French transport ministry sources underlined that without an accepted  flight plan, no pilot can take off without violating international regulations  and endangering his passengers' lives.
And Bosson raised the temperature Friday saying "the resulting  consequences for the passengers will be the sole responsibility of the  airlines, so let's make a date for Monday.
"We cannot accept that aircraft turn up like that, any old how, without a  minimum number of rules," he said in this western town. "I am sure that we  will find a solution and that this will take a few weeks."
However, he also attempted to play down the dispute, which he dismissed as  a "storm in a teacup," adding that the row had grown to "ridiculous  proportions."
The government had decided to open Orly-London up to British carriers but  had to settle certain technical, safety and environmental concerns, including  apron congestion.
In a "very gentle" reminder to Britain, Bosson said, "yes, we are going to  open up Orly. But we, who find ourselves in the dock, would like to see  Britain make the same effort to open up Heathrow," Britain's busiest airport.
The British airlines, backed by their government, are insisting they are  entitled to start flights to Orly next week in line with a European Union  ruling ordering France to open three domestic routes to competition:  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles.
British Airways (BA) has said: "We have the rights and the slots, and we  will be starting our first London-to-Orly flights on Monday." The British  government has expressed its "full support" for the airline.
In London, a Civil Aviation Authority spokesman noted that the easiest way  in practice for the French to prevent BA and other airlines from serving Orly  was to reject the flight plan, which every pilot has to submit an hour before  takeoff.
The first scheduled flight to Orly is due to leave Heathrow airport at  6:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) Monday and arrive in Paris an hour later.
Foreign competition through Orly is also seen as a threat to the  loss-making national carrier Air France and its domestic subsidiary Air Inter.  Unions at Air Inter have called a strike for Tuesday in protest over the  opening of the routes.
The routes through Orly are coveted by foreign companies because all  domestic French flights leave from the airport.
Last year, 9.7 million passengers used the Orly-Sud international part of  the terminal while 15.7 million passed through Orly-Ouest, reserved for the  domestic carrier Air-Inter.
French analysts believe British airlines are keen to capture the estimated  half a million French passengers who use Air Inter each year to fly to Paris  to catch a foreign connection.
A transport ministry source said the French government was eager above all  to negotiate a reciprocity agreement with Britain before opening Orly to  British aircraft, as the European Commission has ordered.
Air France and Air Outremer have filed applications to use Heathrow  airport in London which were rejected on grounds that the airport was already  too congested.
Until now, all flights to London from Paris have left from Roissy-Charles  de Gaulle airport, flying to four London airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted  and London City Airport.

Southern leaders put forward a seven-point  plan Friday to end nine days of civil war in Yemen between rival north and  south forces, an official source said here.
The plan proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party, which is headed  by ousted vice president Ali Salem al-Baid, calls for an "immediate end to the  war" and the creation of a government of national unity.

Southern leaders put forward a seven-point  plan Friday to end nine days of civil war in Yemen between rival north and  south forces, an official source said here.
The plan proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party, which is headed  by ousted vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, calls for an "immediate end to the  war" and the creation of a government of national unity.
The government would be charged with "wiping out the consequences of the  war" and conducting an inquiry into "those responsible for the war," the  source said.
Baid, who was sacked last week as vice-president by the northern-dominated  parliament in the capital Sanaa, has said a ceasefire would depend on the  withdrawal of northern forces from the south.
His northern rival, President Ali Abdallah Saleh, has said he would only  accept a ceasefire if the southerners agreed to accept his government, respect  the country's unity and put all armed forces under the government's control.
The rival armies of former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since May 5, shattering four years of uneasy union between the  conservative north and the Marxist south.

The Footsie rose slightly during the week, despite  constantly looking over its shoulder at US shares and futures prices and  generally taking little heed of reassuring performances from British companies.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed at 3,119.2 points on Friday,  a weekly rise of 13.2 points or 0.4 percent.
The index owes this slight weekly rise to a signifcant lift on Tuesday,  when shares rose 1.2 percent on hopes that the Bundesbank would cut key  interest rates at its bi-monthly meeting on Wednesday.
Hopes of a cut in British rates were firmly squashed on Thursday after  Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie  George warned of the dangers of overheating the economy.
In its quarterly report, the Bank of England also expressed concern about  a resurfacing of inflation, particularly after British consumer credits rose  by a record 516 million pounds (774 million dollars) in March, compared to  analysts' expectations of 325 million pounds.
Insurance companies in general gained little from better first-quarter  results.
Commercial Union, which almost quadrupled its pre-tax profits to 64  million pounds, dipped seven pence to 568, while General Accident fell two  pence to 559 despite a 46 percent hike in pre-tax profits, and Royal Insurance  inched up one pence to 261.
The media group Pearson was one of the main winners during the week,  soaring 41 pence to 673 after announcing a joint satellite television venture  with the BBC.
British Gas rose eight pence to 301.5, as the market belatedly welcomed a  report by the industry watchdog Ofgas on increased competition in the gas  distribution sector.
SmithKline Beecham rose 12 pence to 406 after announcing it was to market  a generic form of cimetidine, the main ingredient in its anti-ulcer drug  Tagamet, in the US.
The Royal Bank of Scotland jumped 25 pence to 432 after doubling its  half-yearly pre-tax profits to 201 million pounds.
But investors were not impressed by results from Unilever and Grand  Metropolitan. Unilever slumped 51 pence to 1,023 while Grand Met fell 14 pence  to 453 after reporting prudent provisions for its drinks brands.
Finally, British Airways fell 25 pence to 391 as dealers were worried about  the company's intention to complete its first flight from London to Paris'  Orly airport despite opposition from the French government.

Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck will  travel to Poland on Monday to visit his Polish counterpart Piotr Kolodziejczyk  and sign a cooperation agreement, the foreign ministry said Friday.
The agreement involves an exchange of information of defense issues  whereby the two countries will expand their cooperation within the industrial  defense sector.
The two ministers will also exchange views on peacekeeping and military  education during the one-day visit.
Bjoerck will also meet Polish President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak.

Cuban wrestler Lazaro Reinoso, an Olympic  bronze medallist in 1992, defected in Miami as he traveled with the Cuban team  to a meet in the United States, a Cuban exile group said Friday.
The 24-year-old Reinoso apparently asked for political asylum while  clearing customs at Miami International airport on Thursday night.
"He said his biggest ambition was to come to the United States to be a  free man and to compete as a member of the US wrestling team," said Mario  Miranda, a spokesman for the Cuban American National Foundation.
Miranda said two other Cuban wrestlers, Jesus Wilson and Josvani Negret,  disappeared after leaving the plane.
"Nobody knows where the other two went," Miranda said. "They just walked  out of the airport."
Two Cuban rowers, Usbiel Himely Medina and Tatiana Valdez Sarria, have  arrived in Miami after coming into America through Texas earlier this week,  Miranda said. He said both plan to ask for asylum.

The US embassy said Friday its consular  section that handles non-immigrant visas was closed until further notice.
Other consular sections of the embassy will remain open, an embassy source  said.
No reason was given for the action, which came two days after the  investiture of Emile Jonassaint as provisional president over protests by  Washington and the international community.
The United States has announced a ban on visas for military, members of  their families and all supporters of the regime.
A ban on non-commercial flights to the United States already is hitting  the country's mango exporters, who are in the midst of a harvest.
The US actions followed a UN Security Council resolution last Friday that  imposed an immediate ban on visas for the military, ordered their overseas  assets frozen and cut off non-commercial air links to Haiti.

Beaten Kentucky Derby favorite Holy  Bull will miss the Preakness with minor physical problems, the colt's  owner-trainer Jimmy Croll said Friday.
"There were a couple of things wrong," Croll said. "Nothing drastic, but  the vet said it would be better to give him seven or eight extra days."
Croll said there was nothing wrong with Holy Bull when he finished 12th in  the Kentucky Derby last Saturday, a defeat he called "strictly a bad case of  circumstances."
Holy Bull was bumped at the start of the Derby and slammed again in the  first turn on the muddy Churchill Downs track.
Croll still plans to run Holy Bull in the one and one-half mile Belmont  Stakes, the final race of the Triple Crown.

Senior officials of the United Nations, the US  administration and members of Congress used a Senate hearing Friday to  denounce the havoc abandoned land mines are causing civilians.
"Every month, at least 1,200 people, mostly innocent civilians who have  nothing to do with any war or conflict, are killed or maimed for life by these  tiny, silent explosives," said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who led the  hearings.
Ken Rutherford, a relief worker, recalled how he was maimed when his  vehicle hit an anti-tank mine in Somalia in December.
"The Land Rover lurched forward a little, and the inside filled with  dust," he said.
"I slowly looked at Duale (the driver), whose face was covered with dust,  then down to my feet.  I saw a white bone sticking out where my right foot  used to be. At first, I wondered if it was Duale's bone or mine. It was mine."
More than a million people, most of them civilians, have been killed or  wounded by mines since 1975. An estimated 100 million of them are still  planted in about 60 countries and about 1.2 million are in arsenals around the  world. About 50 countries produce some 300 types of mines, and about 30  countries export them.
Sadaka Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, explained that the  presence of mines were hurting UN efforts to moved people displaced by war  back to their homes.
"Bringing people back to their countries, we have to make sure that the  roads to go back are safe," she said, noting that the United Nations have  stepped up their education and prevention efforts.
Ogata singled out Afghanistan, where each year 4,000 people are killed and  4,000 wounded by mines. Guatemala, Somalia, Iraq, Mozambique, Cambodia are  other countries that are most affected by the problem, she said.
"Nobody puts money in mine clearance research," said retired general  Patrick Glagden, director of the United Nation's mine clearing program. At the  same time, modern mines are made of plastic and escape metal detectors.
"I'm losing this war," he said.
Thomas McNamara, a senior State Department official in charge of  politico-military affairs, said it would be extremely difficult to ban mines,  especially since they are not considered illegitimate weapons as is the case  with chemical or biological weapons.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala  Lasso made an impassioned plea Friday for the world to end the "unimaginable  human tragedy" in Rwanda.
"The world must do something to halt this violence," said Ayala Lasso, who  arrived in Europe Thursday from five days in Kigali, where he met with the  chiefs of the Hutu-led government army and the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic  Front.
He obtained assurances from the government army that several thousand  civilians held captive in the capital would be freed soon.
He said he had asked the warring parties to guarantee the safe delivery of  humanitarian aid, but added: "the international community must really commit  itself to putting pressure on this country."
Ayala Lasso said the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had both welcomed  his proposal to set up a commission to determine the causes of the massacres  which have left some 200,000 dead in the tiny highland central African state,  and responsibility for them.
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees meanwhile said that  with US planes now operating an airbridge taking aid to some 250,000 Rwandan  refugees in Tanzania had intensified, and was flying in plastic sheeting for  shelters.
Some 2,000 refugees are continuing to cross the border each day, said  spokesman Ron Redmond.
In Paris, foreign ministry spokesman Richard Duque said France had asked  the United Nations to ensure that UN troops in Rwanda protect refugees  sheltering in the Milles Collines Hotel in Kigali, saying they had been  threatened.
France supported a proposal by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for beefing up the UN troop strength in Rwanda, he said, and it appeared the  warring parties had agreed to this.
Theogene Rudasingwa, the secretary general of the Patriotic Front,  meanwhile told a press conference in Johannesburg that he was "shocked" that  France should refuse to support "the real democratic forces of the Rwandan  opposition" rather than the government, which was behind the "massacre of the  Tutsis."

Play at the Byron Nelson Golf Classic was  rained out again on Friday, jeopardizing chances that at least three rounds  could be played by Sunday.
The saturated Tournament Players Club course at Las Colinas had another  inch of rain dumped on it early Friday.
Officials had hoped to start play Friday afternoon, but conditions would  not allow it.
Tournament chairman Plack Carr said two courses, the TPC and the  Cottonwood Valley course nearby, would be used on Saturday. The field of 156  will be split, and once players complete 18 holes they will change courses and  play until nightfall.
"Few of our players will have played 36 holes, but we believe all of them  will have played 27 holes," said PGA Tour official Duke Butler.
The second round was scheduled to be completed Sunday morning, with the  final round later in the day.
Weather could still thwart the plans. Thunderstorms were forecast for  Friday night and Saturday morning.
"In the event of further inclement weather, we will meet again and decide  what to do," Butler said.

Northern leaders rejected late Friday a southern  ceasefire plan to end fighting which has opposed rival forces for the past  nine days, an official spokesman told AFP.
The spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni capital Sanaa that there  was "nothing new" in the seven-point plan put forward in Aden by the southern  Yemen Socialist Party.

Graham Gooch and David Ward were double ton kings  on Friday as early-season championship pacesetters Surrey and Essex turned on  the heat.
The 40-year-old Essex captain, a cast-iron certainty to earn a Test recall  this summer, hammered the Kent attack for 236 at Chelmsford as his side piled  up 446 for three, a lead of 255.
Gooch hit 28 four and three sixes in the ninth double century of his  career and shared a county record opening stand of 316 with Paul Prichard, who  compiled a fine 109.
It kept Essex hard on the heels of leaders Surrey, for whom Ward and  Graham Thrope plundered the weakened Derbyshire attack for 301 in a rampaging  third wicket stand.
Ward achieved the double ton for the third time in his career and was  unbeaten on 216, having hit five sixes and 23 fours, out of his side's 373 for  five, a lead of 165 after Surrey had bowled out the visitors for 208.
Thorpe, dropped on 18, made a patient 114 with 17 fours after Derbyshire,  without flu victim Devon Malcolm and with Ole Mortensen (hamstring), Dominic  Cork (knee) and Phil DeFreitas (sore toe) all sidelined.
England chairman of selectors Ray Ilingworth saw Leicestershire paceman  David Millns take four for 62 as the home side bowled out Somesrset for 288 at  Grace Road. Peter Hepworth and Ben Smith hit half centuries to help  Leicestershire to 236 for four in reply.
Paul Johnson, another England hopeful, staked his claim with 101 for  Nottinghamshire against Durham at Trent Bridge.
He shared in a fourth wicket stand of 125 with West Indies all rounder  Jimmy Adams (60) but Notts wasted their good work by losing their last five  wickets for just 18 runs and were all out for 278, a lead of 43.
David Graveney bagged six for 80, his best figures for Durham, who knocked  off the arrears in closing at 58 for one.
Martin Speight rescued Sussex against Hampshire at Hove with a timely 126  - his first championship century of the season.
Speight, who took 35 minutes to score his first run, struck five sixes and  16 fours from 147 balls. His second 50 came off only 28 deliveries.
He and England leg-spinner Ian Salisbury (49) put on 151 for the seventh  wicket after Sussex slumped to 73 for six, chasing Hampshire's 267.
The home side were finally dismissed for 279 and Hampshire replied with 44  for one.
Richard Stemp's left-arm spin put Yorkshire in command at Cardiff, where  Glamorgan slumped 158 for eight, 32 runs short of saving the follow-on.
Stemp was on the brink of a career-best, having taken five for 41 from 23  overs and needing one further wicket at a low cost tomorrow.
Yorkshire had finished with a creditable 339 after Richard Blakey (87)  and Darren Gough (54) led a recovery.
Gloucestershire captain Courtney Walsh kept Worcestershire in the field  for nearly 10 hours and then added to their misery by taking two for 25 before  the close at New Road.
The double dismissal of openers Tim Curtis and Philip Weston - both leg  before - justified Walsh's tactics in letting his side's first innings dawdle  to 390 in 152.1 overs.
Worcestershire, set of 241 to avoid the follow on, struggled to 51 for two  off 18 overs.

Northern Yemeni leaders rejected late Friday a  southern ceasefire plan to end fighting which has opposed rival forces for the  past nine days, and demanded the surrender of southern chiefs.
An official spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni capital Sanaa that  there was "nothing new" in the seven-point plan put forward in Aden by the  southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP).
He said that "the legitimate leadership in Sanaa demands the surrender of  the war criminal" ousted vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, who heads the YSP.
They also wanted the surrender of "all the others responsible for the war,  so that they can be judged for war crimes."
The plan put forward Friday by the YSP called for an "immediate end to the  war" and the creation of a government of national unity.
The government would be charged with "wiping out the consequences of the  war" and conducting an inquiry into "those responsible for the war," a source  said in the southern stronghold of Aden.

Chinese dissident Chen Ziming, one of the  leading figures during the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was released from  prison Friday to receive medical treatment, the official Xinhua news agency  reported.
Chen's temporary release follows the Chinese government's release of five  Christians from re-education camps, as well as the liberation of two other  dissidents, in an apparent attempt to persuade US President Bill Clinton to  extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status.
Chen, a 40-year-old economist and publisher of the reformist Economic  Weekly, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in February 1991 for "conspiring to  subvert the government and "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement."
Chen "has been released on bail for medical treatment today with the  permission of the Chinese judicial authorities," Xinhua said, in a short  dispatch monitored here that provided no other details.
The five Christians released Friday were identified as Chen Zhuman, Yan  Peizhi, Xu Zhihe, Cui Tai and Zhang Li.
They had been sentenced to re-education in Fujian province, southeastern  China, Shandong in the east and Hebei in the north for having "disturbed  public order and endangering public security by their religious activities,"  the agency said.
The move came a day after Chinese authorities said they had released one  dissident and allowed a second to leave for the United States. But they  arrested a third, sending mixed signals to Washington some three weeks ahead  of Clinton's decision on renewing China's MFN.
Zhang Ruiyu, a Chinese dissident sentenced to four years' jail in 1991,  was released on parole and a dissident intellectual, Yu Haocheng, was given  permission to go to the United States.
But in Shanghai, police arrested Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese  Association for Human Rights.
Yang's arrest was the fifth in a month in Shanghai and confirmed  observers' beliefs that the release of some dissidents would not affect the  repression of others ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen  massacre.
The sentence handed down on Chen was one of the heaviest for any leader of  the 1989 movement which culminated in the Chinese army's bloody supression of  protestors in Tiananmen Square.
Chen, who came from the eastern province of Zhejiang, was director of the  private Beijing Social-Economic Research Institute as well as a contributor to  the Economic Weekly.
During his period of detention in Qincheng prison, Chen had secretly  written a book on the history of China since the launching of reforms by  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978. The manuscript was smuggled out of the  prison and published in Hong Kong.
Chen was eighth on the "most-wanted criminals" list issued by the public  security ministry in 1989. The six people who headed the list either managed  to flee China or were allowed to leave by the authorities, such as  astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian.

Dockworkers in Lagos have called off a strike which  paralysed port activities for three days this week, the official News Agency  of Nigeria reported Friday.
Lagos has the two biggest ports in Nigeria. The strikers were demanding  higher wages and social insurance, and to come directly under the labour  ministry and not the port administration.
The strike was called off Thursday after a meeting between representatives  of the dockers and the Minister of Transport and Aviation, Ebenezer Babatope,  who promised that government would look into their their demands, the agency  said.

US and North Korean officials have held a new  round of informal talks on the problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program, a State  Department spokesman said Friday.
"Working-level officials from the State Department met with the North  Korean mission to the United Nations in New York on Thursday afternoon in  connection with efforts to resolve the nuclear issue," David Johnson told  reporters.
It was the third such meeting since February. He refused to comment on the  content of the meeting.
Asked if the United States was now prepared to set a date for a third  round of formal US-North Korean talks, Johnson said Washington would consider  this after International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors complete a visit to  North Korea scheduled to begin this week.
US and North Korean officials have held two rounds of formal talks since  Pyongyang threatened a year ago to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty (NPT), amid fears that it was developing a nuclear weapon.
The talks were aimed at persuading Pyongyang to remain in the NPT and  allow resumption of international inspections of its nuclear installations. In  return, the United States was to discuss improved economic relations and North  Korea's security concerns.
But when little progress was apparent after the second round in July,  Washington said it would not hold a third round until international  inspections had resumed to verify that Pyongyang was not developing a nuclear  weapon, and until North Korea resumed dialogue with the South.
North Korea agreed in February to the inspections, and to the dialogue,  but plans for a third round of talks were called off when the inspectors  reported that they had not been given full access to the sites they wanted to  visit.
The IAEA announced Friday that a team of IAEA inspectors is to leave for  North Korea this weekend to complete the inspections it was unable to carry  out earllier.
It also said that North Korea was willing to hold talks with the agency to  try and narrow differences between the two on the replacement of fuel rods at  a controversial nuclear plant.

The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five European countries united Friday to put the peace process in  Bosnia-Hercegovina back on track, calling for a four-month ceasefire and  resumption of peace negotiations within two weeks.
They urged the warring parties to reach agreement on the basis of a  European plan for the ethnic division of the former Yugoslav republic,  providing 51 percent of the territory for a Bosnian Croat-Moslem federation  and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs.
The Belgrade-backed Serb forces currently hold some 70 percent as a result  their gains in more than two years of war and ethnic cleansing following the  republic's independence.
In a joint declaration, the seven states plus the European Union held out  the prospect of a "phased suspension" of UN-imposed sanctions against Serbia  in return for "good faith" implementation of a peace settlement "that includes  provisions for withdrawal to agreed territorial limits."
But they firmly ruled out as unacceptable any attempt to make sanctions  relief a precondition for the resumption of peace talks.
Inviting the warring parties to begin negotiations within two weeks under  the auspices of the so-called contact group on Bosnia, the ministers  simultaneously instructed the group -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and  the United States -- to start immediately making preparations to facilitate  this.
(Also represented here Friday were Belgium and Greeece.)
They also "took note" of moves being taken to set up a Bosnian-Croat  federation within the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Skirting round a recent Bosnian-Croat demand of 58 percent of the total  territory for this entity, the ministers said they believed that "final  arrangements for the federation must provide it with viable, realistic and  reasonable territory consistent with" the Europeans' 51/49 percent formula.
They further demanded that all parties permit unimpeded delivery of  humanitarian aid in accordance with existing agreements, and insisted on the  release of detained members of humanitarian organizations.
Addressing journalists after the six hours of talks, US Secretary of State  Warren Christopher stressed that a Serb attempt to make resumption of peace  talks conditional on a prior lifting of sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia  (Serbia and Montenegro) was "entirely and absolutely unacceptable."
He and European ministers stressed that they realised there remained great  difficulties and obstacles to a solution, but that they were united in their  purpose of reaching a negotiated political settlement.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who this week threatened that France  would pull out its UN contingent -- the biggest in Bosnia -- if there was no  solution in sight, issued an appeal to the warring parties, saying: "There is  a chance of peace. Don't let it slip away."

Southern leaders put forward a seven-point  plan Friday to end nine days of civil war in Yemen between rival northern and  southern forces, but the offer was swiftly rejected.
An official spokesman in the northern capital Sanaa described it as  "nothing new" and repeated demands for the surrender of southern leaders.
The plan proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), which is  headed by ousted vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, called for an "immediate  end to the war" and the creation of a government of national unity.
The government would be charged with "wiping out the consequences of the  war" and conducting an inquiry into "those responsible for the war," an  official source said.
But from Sanaa a spokesman told AFP by telephone that the north demanded  the surrender of the "war criminal" Baid and "all those responsible for the  war, so that they can be judged for war crimes."
The YSP proposed that the two armies should separate and be "withdrawn to  the positions they held before the war."
All prisoners, whether military or political, should be freed, arrests  should be banned and there should be no torture or legal proceedings, the plan  added.
It called for "the protection of the lives, goods and rights of citizens,  for equal compensation for all the victims of the war including military and  civilians and for all Yemenis killed in the fighting to be considered martyrs."
Thefts from citizens should be stopped and all stolen goods should be  returned or compensated for.
It also called for the rights of political parties to be recognised and  for the multi-party system to be preserved, while the country's leaders should  not give up on implementing a reconciliation accord signed in Amman in  February.
Baid, who was sacked last week as vice president by the northern-dominated  parliament in Sanaa, has said a ceasefire would depend on the withdrawal of  northern forces from the south.
His northern rival, President Ali Abdallah Saleh, has said he would only  accept a ceasefire if the southerners agreed to accept his government, respect  the country's unity and put all armed forces under the government's control.
The rival armies of former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since May 5, shattering four years of uneasy union between the  conservative north and the Marxist south.

A humiliating defeat that snapped a  12-game win streak has sent the Indiana Pacers a wake-up call.
The Pacers set a National Basketball Association (NBA) playoff record for  scoring futility in a 92-69 loss to Atlanta in game two of their quarter-final  series.
"This was good for us," Indiana guard Reggie Miller said. "Any time you're  riding high, sometimes you need a loss like this to bring you down, give you a  reality check."
The best-of-seven series continues here Saturday and Sunday, with Indiana  trying to keep the home-court edge they gained by splitting the first two  games.
"This team will bounce back," Indiana coach Larry Brown said. "It was a  thumping. But we've been thumped before and bounced back."
The Pacers missed 58 of 85 shots in game two. Indiana scoring leader  Miller managed just 12 points, missing 11 of 13 shots. He had scored 18 in  game one.
"After game one, in the back of a lot of our minds, we took game two for  granted," Miller said.
Dutch center Rik Smits miised 11 of 15 shots and pulled down just four  rebounds in game two. His poor play was especially troublesome for Brown.
"I can deal with a bad night on offense, but he has to be a presence  defensively and on the boards," Brown said.
Smits had shut down Orlando center Shaquille O'Neal as the Pacers swept  the Magic in a first-round series.
"We just have to pull ourselves together and come back this weekend,"  Smits said. "We can't take things for granted. We have to fight harder."
---
The Hawks were top seeded in the East playoffs but struggled before  eliminating Miami in the first round. Atlanta has concentrated on shutting  down Smits inside and Miller, among the most accurate NBA shooters from  3-point range and the free throw line.
"Miller is a key," Atlanta's Jon Koncak said. "You have to contain him but  you can't foul him and can't let him shoot 3-pointers. Smits is the X-factor."
Indiana's Byron Scott, a veteran who played on NBA title teams for the Los  Angeles Lakers, said the Pacers were beaten before they started game two.
"We didn't act like a team that had won 12 in a row," he said. "Half the  battle was coming out and playing physical. We lost before we ever got  started. They reminded us we can be beaten and they aren't Orlando."
Indiana guard Haywoode Workman expects a more aggressive Indiana team this  weekend.
"We need to come out and attack the basket, attack them on defense," he  said. "We've got to play like wild people out there. The challenge is there.  Everybody will step up and do what they have to. The streak is over, but the  series isn't."

The Church of England said Friday it had lifted its  decades-old ban on investing its cash in South Africa, following the country's  first non-racial elections.
But the decision is unlikely to mean an immediate movement of substantial  sums into South African companies, said a statement for the Church  Commissioners, who deal with the Church of England's investments.
"The Commissioners aren't substantial overseas investors and it is  unlikely that we will start to invest in South Africa itself," the statement  said, adding: "...proper research and monitoring will continue to ensure any  potential investment conforms to ethical guidelines."
The ban was part of an "ethical investment" policy agreed in the 1960s.

Southern leaders put forward a seven-point ceasefire  plan here Friday as fighting between rival north and south Yemeni forces  continued to rage outside the southern stronghold of Aden.
The plan, proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), called for  an immediate end to the nine-day war and the creation of a national unity  government.
But it was swiftly rejected by northern leaders as "nothing new." They  repeated demands made at the beginning of the conflict for southern leaders to  surrender.
A spokesman in Sanaa told AFP by telephone that the north demanded the  surrender of the "war criminal" ousted vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid and  "all those responsible for the war, so that they can be judged for war crimes."
The YSP proposed the two armies should separate and be "withdrawn to the  positions they held before the war."
A source in Aden said a national unity government should be charged with  "wiping out the consequences of the war" and conducting an inquiry into "those  responsible for the war."
But the northern spokesman said there was "no need to form a national  unity government, since the legitimate government is already in place."
The rival armies of former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since May 5, shattering four years of uneasy union between the  conservative north and the Marxist south.
The YSP plan, drawn up by the party's political office, also called for  prisoner releases, for the rights of political parties to be recognised and  that the lives, goods and rights of citizens be protected.
And it demanded "equal compensation for all the victims of the war  (...)  and for all Yemenis killed in the fighting to be considered martyrs."
Meanwhile a southern military spokesman said southern forces had brought  down three northern planes in fighting close to Bab al-Mandeb, at the mouth of  the Red Sea, and sunk a northern warship off Aden.
The reports were hotly denied by an official spokesman in Sanaa who said  that the north "does not have any warships or patrol boats in the area."
But southerners said one of the pilots had been taken hostage and would  testify that his plane had been brought down when his health had recovered  sufficiently.
Earlier a southern enovy on a visit to Damascus told Syrian President  Hafez al-Assad that a new front had opened at Bab al-Mandab, 100 kilometres  (60 miles) west along the coast from Aden.
He told Syrian radio, in an interview monitored by the BBC, that "this is  detrimental both to Yemen and international navigation."
North and south spokesman said earlier that both sides were also battling  for control of Al Daleh, about 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of Aden, with  both sides claiming they had the upper hand.
Al Daleh lies in the mountains commanding a key position on a strategic  route towards the main southern air base at Al Anad.
The YSP proposal came as Arab League mediators were in Yemen in a bid to  try to broker a ceasfire agreement.
They were waiting to meet with President Ali Abdallah Saleh, a northerner,  to try to convince him to make peace with his southern rival Baid.
Aden meanwhile was making preparations to shelter refugees fleeing south  from the fighting around Al Daleh.
Despite limited resources, schools were being used as makeshift  accommodation and supplies of basic foodstuffs were being handed out.
Baid, who was sacked last week as vice-president by the northern-dominated  parliament in the capital Sanaa, has said a ceasefire would depend on the  withdrawal of northern forces from the south.
Saleh, has said he would only accept a ceasefire if the southerners agreed  to accept his government, respect the country's unity and put all armed forces  under the government's control.

He noted the "unusual" breadth of the Geneva meeting -- participants also  included British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel and their Russian counterpart Andrei Kozyrev, as well as the Belgian  and Greek ministers and European Commissioner Hans van den Broek.
Christopher said they would meet again if and when necessary, but  stressed:  "We don't want to impose a settlement but to facilitate a  settlement, to provide the best environment. It's up to the parties themselves  to reach an agreement."
The secretary of state said the dangers of the situation and the continued  suffering of the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina had made Friday's meeting  necessary.
Juppe said it was the first time that Russia, the United States and the  European states had agreed upon a concrete course rather than vague terms.
Hurd also expressed satisfaction at the unity they had shown, after  reports of differences between the US, Europe and Russia over Bosnia which had  hindered peace efforts.
Asked about the situation if the Serbs refused to negotiate within two  weeks, Christopher said: "We think they must recognise that the world needs a  negotiated settlement." But this was a hypthothetical question and they would  "just have to watch things unfold."
Juppe said the plan would "either work or not work. Allow me to opt this  evening for the hypothesis that it will work".
Regarding the threat to withdraw France's 6,000 men from Bosnia rather  than their weather another winter there without prospects of peace, he said  that if the plan did not work "we will have to meet again and perhaps change  our thinking."
The French minister said his government was "not in the process of  preparing (a withdrawal), but this is a risk that we are considering."
A senior US official said after the press conference there was "nothing  concrete at this point" to indicate there would be a positive Serb response,  but said the stand taken in Geneva with the prospect of lifting of sanctions  "should be seen as an incentive."
"Some preliminary reports do at least have some indications that they (the  Serbs) may have changed their view on lifting the sanctions as a precondition  (for negotiation). We hope this is an opportunity the Serbs will seize," the  official said.
"We hope the Serbs will take note that the sanctions will continue to be  enforced and that the way to have them lifted is to negotiate."

Arch enemies Israel and Syria could make peace  within the coming months, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin  predicted Friday.
Beilin, speaking during an interview with CNN monitored in Cyprus, said  the "Syrians are the key to the continuation of the peace problem. Without  them there is no comprehensive peace."
He was talking ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, due in Damascus on Sunday on his second peace shuttle within a  month.
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad "prefers to negotiate with us either in  Washington or via the Americans in a kind of shuttle diplomacy," Beilin said,  adding that Israel should accept that.
"I think the American mediation is vital. We will be able to see peace  between us and Syria within months."
Syria has rejected recent calls by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to  hold secret talks, along the lines of the Oslo negotiations which eventually  led to the Israel-PLO autonomy accord for the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of  Jericho.
Talks between Syria and Israel have broken down over the issue of the  Israeli-occupied Golan heights, seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.
Syria warned earlier Friday it still insisted on a total Israeli  withdrawal from the strategic heights and was sceptical about Christopher's  visit.
A Syrian official in Damascus, asking not to be named, charged that Israel  had "minimized the US role by reducing it to a mere postman delivering the  Israeli point of view without any amendment."
The Israelis, during Christopher's last shuttle between Israel and Syria  earlier in May, had proposed "security arrangements before a peace treaty,  then a phased withdrawal over a long period," he said.
But any peace deal with Israel depended on a full withdrawal from the  Golan Heights, which the Jewish state annexed in 1981.
"Any settlement not based on the central issue of land is useless," an  official in Damascus said.
Meanwhile Beilin added that Israel could withdraw totally from the  occupied West Bank within five years.
He said discussions still had to be held with the Palestine Liberation  Organisation over the coming years to solve the issue under the terms of the  Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in September.
"But the permanent solution will be implemented on May 4, 1999. That is  the agreement between us," Beilin added.

Washington is hoping Indian Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao's US tour beginning Saturday will bring better understanding  between the two sides on the thorny nuclear issue, but is not expecting any  breakthrough announcements.
"It is an opportunity to review issues of concern and a chance for Rao and  Clinton to get to know each other better," a senior US official said.
Rao's trip, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to the United States  since Rajiv Gandhi visited in 1987, comes at a time of disagreement between  the two sides on a number of issues, notably India's ambitious nuclear and  missile programmes, Kashmir, human rights and trade.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to cap  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defence programme, and the  Washington trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in  office.
For the US side, "non-proliferation remains the goal" in both India and  Pakistan, and "we are moving along on a broad front, in a lot of different  areas," to try and achieve that, the US official said.
The carrot for Pakistan is the possibility of obtaining delivery of F-16  fighter planes it has already paid for but which were frozen by Congress.
With India there is not such obvious quid pro quo, but there are areas in  which the United States could offer more help, such as science and technology  transfers, US officials say.
In any case, "the bottom line in all this is that you can't buy agreement  either from Pakistan or India on nuclear proliferation issues if they are not  persuaded that this is in their own best security interests," one said.
There has also been friction over Kashmir, with India feeling that the  administration of US President Bill Clinton favors Pakistan in the dispute and  has tacitly encouraged the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir.
---
Washington denies that Clinton has shifted policy on Kashmir, and says it  is a matter of Indian perception.
The US policy has always been the same - that the Kashmir dispute is  something that India and Pakistan should work out between them, taking into  account the wishes of the Kashmir people, the US official said.
Rao made it clear this week that he was not about to cause further  ructions at home by making any major concessions on the nuclear  non-proliferation issue during his Washington trip.
Another key element of the visit is the effort to boost the economic  relationship, which has taken off with the opening up of the Indian economy in  the Rao administration.
Rao arrives in New York Sunday for meetings with the large Indian  community there, then goes on to Houston for talks with business leaders.
He will be in Boston on Tuesday where he will give a lecture at Harvard.
The Indian prime minister's two-day stay in Washington on Wednesday and  Thursday includes a speech to a joint session of congress, and a two-  and-a-half-hour session with President Bill Clinton.
The two men are scheduled to hold a joint press conference after their  meeting Thursday.
Rao is also scheduled to have talks with Defense Secretary William Perry,  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

Calling land mines a threat to many developing  countries, a US official said Friday that Washington will lead a worldwide  effort to remove the devices blamed for thousands of deaths and injuries each  year.
Thomas McNamara, a senior State Department official in charge of  politico-military affairs, said it would be extremely difficult to ban mines,  since they are not considered illegitimate weapons as is the case with  chemical or biological weapons.
But McNamara told a Senate panel that Washington will sponsor a conference  this year or next to raise funds for deactivation of land mines around the  world.
"Land mines have become the weapon of choice in many developing  countries," McNamara said.
"Land mines pose a significant impediment to achieving our foreign policy  objectives in many regions of the world," he added.
President Bill Clinton has urged the Senate to ratify an international  treaty restricting the use of land mines, whose victims are often civilians.
The Senate panel received written statements supporting the restrictions  from UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and former US president Jimmy  Carter.
"Every month, at least 1,200 people, mostly innocent civilians who have  nothing to do with any war or conflict, are killed or maimed for life by these  tiny, silent explosives," said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who led the  hearings.
---
More than a million people, most of them civilians, have been killed or  wounded by mines since 1975. An estimated 100 million of them are still  planted in about 60 countries and about 1.2 million are in arsenals around the  world. About 50 countries produce some 300 types of mines, and about 30  countries export them.
Sadaka Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, explained that the  presence of mines were hurting UN efforts to moved people displaced by war  back to their homes.
"Bringing people back to their countries, we have to make sure that the  roads to go back are safe," she said, noting that the United Nations have  stepped up their education and prevention efforts.
Ogata singled out Afghanistan, where each year 4,000 people are killed and  4,000 wounded by mines. Guatemala, Somalia, Iraq, Mozambique, Cambodia are  other countries that are most affected by the problem, she said.
"Nobody puts money in mine clearance research," said retired general  Patrick Glagden, director of the United Nation's mine clearing program. At the  same time, modern mines are made of plastic and escape metal detectors.
International representatives concluded the treaty on in Geneva in the  fall of 1980. The United States signed on in 1982, but has failed to ratify it.
More than 100 million landmines lie unexploded in at least 62 countries,  human rights groups reported. They also said worldwide production may be  reaching 10 million anti-personnel landmines annually. The American Red Cross  reported landmines kill more than 200 civilians every week.
Clinton termed the treaty "a modest but significant humanitarian effort to  protect the victims of armed conflict from the effects of particular weapons."
He also said ratification would strengthen US efforts urging an  international moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines.

A former guerrilla leader running for president  burst into a studio in the middle of a televised debate between the two  leading candidates to protest his being excluded from the program.
Antonio Navarro, who headed the M-19 movement known for its spectacular  stunts, suddenly appeared in the television studio Thursday where the first  debate of its kind in Colombia's political history was taking place between  Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Sampler and Conservative Andres Pastrana.
"Hello Antonio," was all the terrified Samper could manage to say, while a  calmer Pastrana said, "Would you like to sit down with us, Antonio?"
The moderator, television personality Yamid Amat, ended the awkwardness by  ordering a cut to a commercial. After the break, Navarro was gone.
The ex-guerrlla leader, who according to polls is likely to get less than  10 percent of the vote in the May 29 elections, said in a radio interview  shortly after the incident that he wanted to show there were more than just  two candidates on the scene.
Navarro's M-19 movement grabbed the headlines for stealing Simon Bolivar's  sword in 1976, taking over the Dominican Republic embassy in 1980 and  attacking the capital's justice center in 1985, an incident in which some 20  people died. He left the guerrilla movement in 1990.

Canada's Paul Tracy, a pole favorite  for the Indianapolis 500, suffered a crash here Friday during a practice lap  and was hospitalized.
Tracy was taken to Methodist Hospital here complaining of pain in his left  foot, but was awake and alert.
Doctor Henry Bock, medical director at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,  said Tracy lost consciousness briefly during the crash. Tracy will undergo  neurological tests and an X-ray examination at the hospital.
Tracy drives a Mercedes-powered Penske car, one of three that have the  best times during practice for the May 29 Indy race. The Penske motor takes  advantae of a rule loophole allowing extra boost over convention Indy engine  designs.
The crash caused extensive damage to the car, leaving little chance it  will be ready for Saturday's start of time trials. Tracy's backup car has not  taken a lap at Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile (4km) oval.
Tracy's car went out of control and skidded through the third turn into  the infield grass. The car then spun across the track and into the fourth-turn  outer wall, hitting on the left front side and coming to a stop on the edge of  the track.
Tracy was on a fast lap after building speed on a warm-up effort. He had  reached a top speed of 228.693 mph (365.908 km/h) and was clocked at 240 mph  (384 km/h) a few minutes earlier on the same area of track where the crash  began.

Blue-chip stocks posted modest gains Friday in a  mixed trading session marked by easing of interest rates eclipsed in part by  weakness in technology stocks.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials rose 6.84 points to close at  3,659.68.
On the broader market, declining shares slightly outnumbered advancers  1,075 to 1,027 with 677 shares unchanged. Some 252 million shares were traded.
The market got a boost from a drop in yields on 30-year Treasury bonds to  7.49 percent from 7.56 percent Thursday, a sign of declining fears among  investors over inflation and higher interest rates.
The decline in rates came after the government reported consumer prices  rose a modest 0.1 percent in April, which confirmed low inflation following  Thursday's report of a 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices in April.
Bob Walberg of MMS Internation said the markets had already anticipated a  half-point boost in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
"The markets fear the two inflation reports will lead the Fed to raise  interest rates by only 25 basis points (one-quarter point) instead of 50,"  Walberg said. "The market wants to see a more aggressive move by the Fed  despite the relatively passive inflation numbers."
Fears of a decline in the growth rate of the computer industry caused a  drop in technology stocks. Compaq Computer fell 1-1/8 to 104-3/8, Sears 1-3/8  to 47-3/8 and AMR Corp. 2-1/2 to 53-1/8.
Philip Morris rose 1-5/8 to 52-1/8, Dow Chemical1 to 66-3/8 and J.P.  Morgan 1-1/2 to 63-1/8.

Here are extracts of the final statement on the  peace process in Bosnia-Hercegovina, agreed in Geneva on Friday by the foreign  ministers of Russia, the United States, and five European Union countries.
"The ministers underscore their resolve and unity of purpose in working  for an early and durable settlement of the Bosnian conflict. They reaffirm  that the conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina cannot be resolved by military  means and must be settled through negotiations."
"Only a peaceful settlement will command the support of the international  community and offer the peoples of Bosnia and Hercegovina the prospect of a  secure future."
"They confirm their support for a settlement that preserves Bosnia and  Hercegovina as a single Union within its internationally recognised borders,  while providing for constitutional arrangements that establish the  relationship between the Bosnian-Croat and Bosnian Serb entities."
"The ministers express their strong concern that in the wake of the recent  Bosnian Serb attack on the UN-declared safe area of Gorazde, the negotiating  process has been set back. They warn all the parties concerning the  unacceptability and risks of pursuing military solutions."
"In this regard, they support the determination of the international  community to take necessary action to protect the safe areas within Bosnia and  Hercegovina, established in accordance with (UN) Security Council resolutions  824 and 836 (and) express their full support for strict enforcement of these  resolutions, decisions and agreements."
"The ministers demand that all parties permit the unimpeded delivery of  humanitarian assistance in accordance with existing agreements (and) insist on  the release of those members of humanitarian organisations in detention."
They "endorse efforts currently being made by (the UN Protection Force)  UNPROFOR and under way in the Security Council to prevent offensive action in  safe areas, particularly in and around Brcko."
The ministers "call on the parties to conclude a comprehensive cessation  of hostilities and to resume in parallel, without preconditions, serious  efforts to reach a political settlement."
"The agreement on cessation of hostilities must include the separation of  forces, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the interposition of UNPROFOR  troops. On the basis of previous discussions with the parties, the ministers  believe the agreement should be for a period of four months, with provision  for extension."
"To complete its task (...) UNPROFOR will need further reinforcement."
"Previous negotiations have established the concept of a territorial  compromise based on 51 percent for the Bosnian-Croat entity and 49 percent for  the Bosnian Serb entity. Ministers urge the parties to reach an agreement on  this basis."
"Final arrangements for the Bosnian-Croat federation "must provide it with  viable, realistic and reasonable territory consistent with the concept  described above."
"Any attempt to make sanctions relief a precondition for resuming talks is  unacceptable. Good-faith implementation of a peace settlement that includes  provisions for withdrawal to agreed territorial limits will lead to phased  suspension of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations."
"With a view to achieving an early settlement within this framework, the  ministers invite the parties to begin substantive negotiations under the aegis  of the Contact Group within the next two weeks."
"The Contact Group was instructed to immediately commence all the  necessary substantive preparations."

The Dominican Republic's President Joaquin  Balaguer, at 87 seeking his 7th term as president, wrapped up his campaign  Friday with a huge rally that attracted tens of thousands of people.
Waving banners and beating drums, Balaguer's supporters cheered as the  87-year-old, who is nearly blind, pledged in a short but clear speech that if  re-elected, he would struggle "with all my might to maintain economic, social  and political stability."
Balaguer, who has dominated this island of seven million people for  decades, has been most closely challenged by black leader Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez for Monday's vote.
Like Pena Gomez and other contenders, Balaguer has promised to focus his  attention on the poorest in his Caribbean nation, especially access to clean  water, health care and public transport.
Balaguer was first named president by dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960.  But Trujillo was assassinated a year later after 31 years in power and  Balaguer was removed in a civilian-military uprising in January 1960.
Juan Bosch, another presidential candidate this year, was elected in 1962  but removed in a September 1963 coup. After a failed 1965 coup to return Bosch  to power, Balaguer was re-elected for three consecutive terms (1966-1970;  1970-1974 and 1974-1978). He returned to the presidency in 1986 and was  re-elected again in 1990.
Around 30 people have died in political violence during street protests  and rallies for the May 16 poll. But there have been no deaths this week, and  Balaguer and Pena Gomez have both urged their supporters to refrain from  violence.
Also Friday, about 100 representatives of the Roman Catholic church,  business and union leaders urged all political parties running candidates to  respect the outcome.
They also urged the the electoral officials to quickly give out an  accurate count of the vote.
In addition to a presidential race, there are 30 senate races, 100  deputies and 103 mayors.
---
In his speech, Balaguer attacked Pena Gomez without naming him, saying  that "from outside or inside the government I will also serve the country  because I am proud of having been born in the Dominican Republic."
Anonymous campaign fliers have surfaced accusing Pena Gomez of being the  "son of Haitians." Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of  Hispanola with Haitians frequently the object of scorn here.
Balaguer's Christian Social Reformist Party has said that Pena Gomez plans  to open refugee camps in the Dominican Republic for Haitians to ingratiate  himself with the United States.
Around 500,000 Haitians live illegally in the Dominican Republic, which  has caused friction with some sectors of the country where unemployment is  about 30 percent.
Haiti is overwhelmingly black, while the Dominican Republic is 75 percent  mulato, 15 percent white and 10 percent black.
Pena Gomez has accused Balaguer of planning to take the vote by fraud, if  necessary.
A spokesman for his Democratic Revolutionary Party, Nery Cabrera, alleged  that some 300,000 voter cards that should have been cancelled would be used by  Balaguer's party to ensure his re-election.
Per capital income is about 790 dollars annually while about 20 percent of  the population is illiterate.

President Bill Clinton was to name Stephen  Breyer, a Massachusetts federal judge, as his nominee to the US Supreme Court,  an administration official said Friday.
Breyer, 55, seen as a moderate consensus-builder, had been favored by  Clinton last year before he named Ruth Ginsburg.

Breyer, 55, seen as a moderate consensus-builder, had been favored by  Clinton last year before he named Ruth Ginsburg.
Clinton's decision ends speculation over the nominee to replace Justice  Harry Blackmun, who is retiring, on the highest US court -- one of the three  centers of power under the US constitution.
Named for life, the nine Supreme Court justices have a huge role in  determining the course of American society.
In recent decades, the court has ended segregation, given blacks political  power, legalized abortion and restored the death penalty.

An old friend of President Bill Clinton,  Supreme Court designate Stephen Breyer is a moderate consensus-builder who  most likely lost a nomination last year because he had a "nanny problem."
The 55-year-old Breyer, nominated Friday to court, should be easily  confirmed to replace retiring Justice Harry Blackmun and become the 108th  justice named to the nation's highest court.
Breyer had been a favorite to replace justice Byron White in 1993 but was  believed to have lost the nomination on revelations that he had failed to pay  social security taxes for a household employee for more than a decade. Ruth  Bader Ginsburg was named in his stead.
Breyer, a New Englander, studied law at Harvard University and became a  clerk for then-Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg. In the 1970s, he taught  antitrust and administrative law at Harvard Law School.
In 1973, he helped prosecute some Watergate cases. Six years later, he  went to work as an aide to Senator Edward Kennedy, a Democratic from  Massachusetts and a stalwart on the Judiciary Committee.
Building a reputation as a hardworking intellectual with an ability to  build consensus, Breyer was next named to a federal commission to set  sentencing guidelines. The panel's decision to toughen some sentences has  angered factions in the judicial community who feel that the guidelines do not  give judges enough leeway.
Breyer was named to the 1st Circuit Court in December 1980 and became  chief judge 10 years later. As a sign of his political savvy, he was nominated  by then-President Jimmy Carter in 1980 and confirmed after Carter's defeat.
Breyer has been reversed by the Supreme Court twice.
In 1982, he ruled that Hustler magazine could not be sued for libel in New  Hampshire because it had few connections to the state. The high court  disagreed, saying that the raunchy magazine was widely available there.
In 1983, he ruled that the Treasury Department could not write a  regulation restricting US citizens' travel to Cuba because the law used in  drafting the regulation did not apply. The Supreme Court overturned Breyer's  decision.

The dollar remained firmed against other major  currencies in quiet trading here Friday after the government reported an  unexpectedly small rise in April consumer prices and because of a long holiday  weekend in Europe.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 380.70 dollars an ounce, up .80 cents from late  Thursday.
At about 16:55 a.m. (2055 GMT), the greenback traded at 1.6695 German  marks, unchanged from mid-day and up from 1.6675 late Thursday.
The US currency also firmed against other major European currencies,  rising to 5.7260 French francs from 5.7200 late Thursday, 1.4260 Swiss francs  (1.4245). Against the pound sterling it stood at 0.6671 (0.6669).
Traders were cautiously awaiting the Federal Reserve's next meeting of its  policy-setting Open Market Committee, on Tuesday. Analysts expect the Fed will  raise the federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight interbank  loans.

Conservative party presidential candidate  Diego Fernandez was the big winner among the three candidates in a landmark  debate that put the three candidates face-to-face, press reports said Friday.
"Diego wins debate" ran headlines in the independent morning paper Reforma  following the debate Thursday night. Its poll of voters in two states put the  conservative candidate well ahead.
The debate made Mexican history -- the first time presidential candidates  were in the same forum arguing the issues. Radio and television broadcasts of  the debate reached a potential 40 million people in a nation of 81 million.
Thursday's debate was the also the latest mark of change in a campaign  turned on its head with the assassination of ruling party candidate Luis  Donaldo Colosio on March 23.
While telephone polls are problematic in Mexico because many poor people  do not have them, the daily El Economista said that in its telephone poll 45  percent of those contacted said Fernandez won the debate.
Still, 47 percent said they would vote for Zedillo if the elections were  held tomorrow. Forty-eight percent said Zedillo put forth the best political  program.
But an Indemerc-Louis Harris poll found that Zedillo was the winner by a  squeaker.
Potential voters said that the ruling party's candidate had the most  experience (40 percent) and the best program for creating jobs and raising  wages (41 percent).
Fernandez was found to be the best speaker (43 percent) and most sure of  himself (41 percent).
An unexpected loser was was Cardenas, 60, the son of a wildly popular  former president, former Michoacan governor who broke from the PRI. In the  Harris poll, he scored best on experience (19 percent) and personality (11  percent).
Zedillo, of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), came under  fire from Fernandez of the National Action Party (PAN) and Cardenas of the  Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) during the 90-minute program.
Cardenas, 60, promised to set up a constitutional assembly in 1997 if he  is elected and called on Fernandez to "fight together for democracy."
The possibility of the PRD and PAN joining forces, political analysts  said, could cost Zedillo the election and end the PRI's 65-year stranglehold  on the government.
Fernandez, a 53-year-old lawmaker, did not respond to Cardenas' proposal  but joined him in calling for a "pluralist government" and for an "end to the  party of state (the PRI)."
After years of hearing only the drone of official statements on television,  Mexicans could hardly believe their ears as the opposition candidates tore  into past and present government policy.
Cardenas and Fernandez called for an end to corruption in the police force  and the justice system, to current economic policy, to poverty gnawing at 40  million Mexicans, to the constitution, to the urbanization of the country, to  unemployment and job insecurity, and to rising prices and violence.
Fernandez showed no mercy for Zedillo.
"You are here because of two tragedies: the March 23 assassination of Luis  Donaldo Colosio (Zedillo's predecessor as PRI candidate) and the 'finger,'"  the PAN candidate said referring to the age-old tradition of PRI presidents  personally choosing their successors.
"The first (tragedy) you had nothing to do with. The second, disqualifies  you from speaking of democracy," Fernandez told the former education and  programming minister.

President Bill Clinton on Friday selected  Stephen Breyer, a Massachusetts federal judge, as his nominee to the US  Supreme Court.
Breyer, 55, seen as a moderate consensus-builder, had been favored by  Clinton last year before he named Ruth Ginsburg. He heads the federal appeals  court in Boston.
Clinton said Breyer represents "excellence in knowldge, excellence in  judgement" and added, "Without dispute he is one of the outstanding jurists of  our age."
Clinton's decision ended days of speculation over the nominee to replace  85-year-old Justice Harry Blackmun, who is retiring from the highest US court  -- one of the three centers of power under the US constitution.
Named for life, the nine Supreme Court justices have a huge role in  determining the course of American society.
In recent decades, the court has ended segregation, given blacks political  power, legalized abortion and restored the death pena, rulings which will have  a lasting impact on the country.

Russia, the United States and western Europe united  Friday in a new bid for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina amid political rumblings  back home over the failure of their sanctions, arms embargo and peace troops  policies to date.
A threat by France, provider of the biggest UN troop contingent, to  withdraw its men should prospects for a solution remain out of sight coincided  with a US Senate move to lift the embargo on arms for the Moslem Bosnians and  a Russian parliament call to abandon sanctions against Serbia.
The combination spurred the seven states plus a European Commission  representative, meeting at foreign minister level in Geneva, to put the peace  process back on track after weeks of drift amid the danger of international  escalation.
A major aspect of the joint declaration arrived at after six hours of  talks is that it holds out the prospect of a "phased suspension" of the United  Nations sanctions against Serbia in return for implementation in good faith of  a negotiated settlement.
The United States had hitherto tended toward a toughening of sanctions  against the regime in Belgrade, while the Russian government has been lukewarm  on them, for reasons that Friday's vote in Moscow showed. The hint is a clear  incentive to the Serbs.
The Europeans can also gain satisfaction from the US acceptance of their  plan to give 51 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina to the Bosnian Croats and  Moslems and 49 percent to the Serbs, as the mainly-Moslem government in  Sarajevo had shown in recent weeks it wanted Washington's support for a bigger  share.
The united call for a four-month extendable ceasefire and peace  negotiations within two weeks comes amid a reiteration of the oft-stated  principle that there must be a negotiated political, and not a  militarily-imposed, settlement, with a comprehensive cessation of hostilities.
The form of the ceasefire is also spelled out, and gives the United  Nations troops on the ground a clear role as a force of interposition, rather  than one limited to protecting humanitarian convoys and the so-called safe  areas as at present.
"The agreement on cessation of hostilities must include the separation of  forces, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the interposition of UNPROFOR (UN  Protection Force) troops," the communique says, adding that this means beefing  rather than withdrawing UN troops.
"To complete its task in the safe areas and in support of the cessation of  hostilities, UNPROFOR will need further reinforcement," it said.
But apart from the tough task the so-called contact group of states has in  trying to get the negotiations restarted, it is a secret for no one that the  western countries which have provided UN troops for Bosnia so far will not  want to provide any more given present public opinion.
On the other hand a meeting in Geneva this same Friday of representatives  of the 51-state Organization of Islamic Conference, while complaining at being  left out of the big-power talks on Bosnia, issued a reminder that its member  have offered to furnish adequate forces should other states withdraw theirs.

President Bill Clinton on Friday selected  Stephen Breyer, a Massachusetts federal judge, as his nominee to the US  Supreme Court.
Breyer, 55, seen as a moderate consensus-builder, had been favored by  Clinton last year before he named Ruth Ginsburg to the court.
Making the announcement at the White House Rose Garden, Clinton said the  chief federal appeals court judge in Boston represents "excellence in  knowldge, excellence in judgement."
"Without dispute he is one of the outstanding jurists of our age," Clinton  added.
Clinton's decision ended days of speculation over the nominee to replace  85-year-old Justice Harry Blackmun, who is retiring from the highest US court.
Named for life, the nine Supreme Court justices have a huge role in  determining the course of American society. The appointees must be confirmed  by the Senate.
In recent decades, the court has ended segregation, given blacks increased  political power, legalized abortion and restored the death penalty.
Clinton acknowledged he was pondering two other candidates, Interior  Secretary Bruce Babbitt, and federal appeals court judge Richard Arnold.
Arnold's chances were derailed by health problems and his connections with  Clinton's home state of Arkansas, and Babbitt was seen as a highly political  choice.
Breyer's chances last year were hurt by revelations that he failed to pay  social security taxes for a domestic worker -- a problem similar to the one  that doomed a Clinton nominee for attorney general.
In 1973, Breyer helped prosecute some Watergate cases and later worked as  an aide to Senator Edward Kennedy on the judiciary panel that will consider  his nomination.
Breyer's connections on Capitol Hill and solid judicial background were  seen as factors in his favor, making his confirmation easier.
Senator Orrin Hatch, the leading Republican on the judiciary panel, has  said he would support Breyer, which virtually assures the nomination.
Clinton has said he hoped his nominee can be confirmed before the Congress  adjourns for the summer.

Breyer was named to the 1st Circuit Court in December 1980 and became  chief judge 10 years later.
The retirement of Blackmun after 24 years on the court gave Clinton his  second nominee and a chance to help reshape the high court after it became  dominated by nominees of Republican presidents.
The court, headed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 69, named by Richard  Nixon, has taken a conservative tilt in recent years.
The other justices are Anthony Kennedy, a 57-year-old moderate  conservative named by Ronald Reagan; Sandra Day O'Connor, a 64-year-old  moderate conservative named by Reagan; Antonin Scalia, 58, another Reagan  appointee who is the leading conservative theorist on the court; David Souter,  54, a moderate conservative named by George Bush; John Paul Stevens, 73, a  Gerald Ford appointee who has wavered from liberal to conservative; Clarence  Thomas, 45, a conservative Bush appointee; and Ginsburg, 61, seen as a  moderate centrist.

Italy's new prime minister, media magnate Silvio  Berlusconi, met the US ambassador to Rome Friday for a "cordial" conversation,  the premier's office said.
Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew passed on US President Bill Clinton's  congratulations to Berlusconi who formed his government this week, more than a  month since general elections, the office said.
Clinton, due to meet Berlusconi in Rome next month, wished the country  success in its renewal process and said he expected to work in close contact  with him for a further strengthening of an already strong bilateral  partnership.
Some western observers have expressed concern about the new cabinet, which  includes neo-fascists from Berlusconi's coalition partners for the first time  since the rule of wartime dictator Benito Mussolini.
Addressing some of those fears, new Defence Minister Cesare Previti sent a  message to NATO, US Defence Secretary William Perry and the Western European  Union underlining his "determination to work on the foundations of traditional  Italian involvement" in western defence and security structures.
He said the encouragement given by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  and strong relations with the United States "constitute fundamental points of  reference for Italy, with the construction of a credible European security  profile."

A strong earthquake struck the southern Philippines  before dawn Saturday, toppling power and communication lines in Pagadian City,  but there were no immediate reports of casualties, seismologists here said.
The temblor, striking at 4:12 a.m. (2012 GMT Friday), registered 5.7 on  the Richter scale and its epicenter was plotted in Illana Bay, a few  kilometers (miles) south of Pagadian, seismologist Lito Lanuza of the  Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told AFP.

Following the lead set by interest rates, share  prices on Wall Street bounced around this past week before closing Friday on a  down note as traders awaited the Federal Reserve's next move.
The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips closed down 9.82 points (0.27  percent) Friday at 3,659.68.
Share prices started the week by dropping 40 points as bond rates rose to  their highest point since November 1992 after the Federal Reserve dashed  expectations that it would raise interest rates.
This intervention had been expected following the release on May 6 of  figures showing employment figures were better than expected.
Quarterly Treasury auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday and the release of  excellent inflation figures on Thursday convinced traders that the Fed would  step in on Tuesday after its Open Market meeting at which monetary policy is  decided.
Interest rates were again pushed higher by the disappointing results of an  auction of 10-year bonds, but they slid lower after the good inflation figures  were released.
While economic figures have reassured traders, most are still expecting  interest rates to rise, said Ed La Varnway, an analyst with First Albany.
It is difficult to predict how the markets will react to the Fed's  intervention, but traders have been expecting it for so long that they would  prefer the Fed to just raise rates "once and for all," said La Varnway.
They are expecting a one-half point increase in the rate that banks charge  each other to four percent and a similar rise in the discount rate to 3.5  percent.
"If the Fed keeps fiddling around with 25 basis point increases, it will  keep the markets on edge," said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst with Prudential  Securities.
---
Traders would rather see the Fed raise interest rates by half a point and  then adopt a neutral position, Zagorski added.
As for future share prices, La Varnway said, "(There is) not enough  evidence to say that the correction is over."
Among the losers for the week, UAL closed Friday at 119-1/4 down from 127  the previous week, ITT was at 82-1/8 down from 87-1/8 and Compaq at 104-3/8  down from 108-7/8.
Among the gainers, Johnson and Johnson was at 42-1/2 up from 40-3/4,  Paramount at 42 from 40 and Bankamerica at 46-3/8 from 44-3/4.
Transports closed Friday at 1,557.72 down from 1,608.92 the previous week  while utilities were at 179.28 down from 188.83.
A total of 1.35 billion shares changed hands this week down from 1.40  billion the previous week.

British Airways (BA) may sue the French government  if it stops the company's flights landing at Orly airport, south of Paris, a  company spokesman said Friday.
The company would consider seeking compensation, the spokesman said.
He did not specify whether the carrier would take immediate action if not  allowed to land Monday when the first British Airways flight to Orly is  scheduled.
British Airways, backed by the British government, is insisting it is  entitled to start flights to Orly Monday in line with a European Commission  ruling last month.
But French authorities have been barring British flights to Orly in  defiance of the decision that ordered France to open three domestic routes --  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseille -- to competition.
The French government has cited congestion at Orly, environmental  considerations and increased access to London's Heathrow airport for French  carriers as issues which need to be resolved before the route is opened.
It is understood that France offered a compromise by suggesting it was  prepared to open Orly to British carriers at the end of June.
British Airways has said: "We have the rights and the slots, and we will  be starting our first London-to-Orly flights on Monday." The British  government has expressed its "full support" for the airline.
Air UK has also stated that it would be "going ahead on Monday."
But French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said British airlines  planning to defy the ban would do so at their own commercial risk.
"All airlines that would play that game will be responsible for the  inconvenience their passengers may experience," he warned.
In a "very gentle" reminder to Britain, Bosson said, "yes, we are going to  open up Orly. But we, who find ourselves in the dock, would like to see  Britain make the same effort to open up Heathrow," Britain's busiest airport.
In London, a Civil Aviation Authority spokesman noted that the easiest way  in practice for the French to prevent BA and other airlines from serving Orly  was to reject the flight plan, which every pilot has to submit an hour before  takeoff.
Air UK has six flights scheduled from Orly to London's Stansted airport  and the first is due to leave the south Paris airport at 7:15 a.m. (0515 GMT).
BA's first of four Orly return flights is from Heathrow at 6:50 a.m. (0550  GMT).
Meanwhile, a third UK airline -- British Midland -- has delayed the start  of its four-flights-a-day Heathrow-Orly service until the row is resolved.

A strong earthquake rocked the southern Philippines  before dawn Saturday, toppling power and communication lines and blacking out  the Pagadian City vicinity, but there were no immediate reports of casualties,  officials said.
The temblor, which struck at 4:12 a.m. (2012 GMT Friday), registered 5.7  on the Richter scale. Its epicenter was in the Illana Bay, a few kilometers  (miles) south of Pagadian, seismologist Lito Lanuza of the Philippine  Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) told AFP.
The quake destroyed at least five houses made of light materials near  Pagadian, and residents of coastal areas were evacuated to higher ground in  case of tsunamis, giant waves caused by earthquakes, senior police officer  Rodolfo Tual told AFP by telephone from Pagadian.
"It was very strong, but it lasted just a few seconds," Tual said, adding  that it reminded him of a major earthquake which caused tsunamis and killed  several hundred people in the south in 1976.
Pagadian police are now out in the streets to evaluate the damage, he  said, adding that there were no immediate reports of casualties.
He said the quake blacked out Pagadian and surrounding areas but that  power was restored about 25 minues later.
Lanuza said local officials in Pagadian reported to Phivolcs that the  temblor toppled power and communication lines and blacked out the city and  nearby eareas.
Two Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. water tank structures in the  city were toppled, he added.
He said several weaker aftershocks were recorded, but that Phivolcs'  initial calculation was that the quake was not the type that would cause  tsunamis.
The temblor was felt throughout the western half of the large southern  island of Mindanao, he added.

Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  backed a US plan to shelter refugees at Rwanda's borders Friday, but warned  that more was needed.
The UN chief renewed his plea to the 15 council members to agree to a plan  to deploy 5,500 troops to Rwanda as part of a UN humanitarian mission,  reinforcing a UN mission reduced to 270 members.
While welcoming the US initiative to establish protected sites for  refugees close to Rwanda's borders with Burundi and Tanzania, Boutros-Ghali  said concentrating on that "would be to only address a small part of the  problem" and could draw more refugees.
"I believe that it is essential that any such initiative should be matched  by action to assist persons in the interior of Rwanda," he said in a report to  the council.
The proposed UN force would be composed of troops from Tanzania, Nigeria,  Ghana, Senegal and Australia, and would include 800 troops in the Rwandan  capital Kigali to protect the airport and other key sites.
But he said such a mission would be facilitated by a ceasefire between  warring factions in Rwanda, which plunged into chaos and bloody ethnic  fighting following the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana April 6 in a  suspicious plane crash.
Earlier on Friday in Paris, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the UN special  representative to Rwanda said the United Nations' top priority was a ceasefire  between rebels and government soldiers and that negotiations on other topics  would come later.
"For now, it is difficult to resume political negotiations so long as  there is no ceasefire," Booh-Booh said.
"A ceasefire is theoretically possible but certain conditions must be  fulfilled" first, he said referring to the Tutsi rebels' refusal to recognize  the transitional government set up following the death of Habyarimana.
In Geneva, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso made an  impassioned plea for the world to end the "unimaginable human tragedy" in  Rwanda.
"The world must do something to halt this violence," said Ayala Lasso  after five days in Kigali where he met with the chiefs of the Hutu-led  government army and the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front.
Ayala Lasso said the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had both welcomed  his proposal to set up a commission to determine the causes of the massacres  which have left some 200,000 dead in the tiny highland eastern African state,  and responsibility for them.
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees meanwhile said that  with US planes now operating an airbridge to take aid to some 250,000 Rwandan  refugees in Tanzania had stepped up its efforts and was flying in plastic  sheeting for shelters.
Some 2,000 refugees are continuing to cross the border each day, said  spokesman Ron Redmond.

Southern troops suffered "heavy losses" when  northern forces recaptured the town of Al Musaymir, northwest of Aden, a  spokesman for the defense ministry announced overnight Friday.
The report came as northern leaders rejected as "nothing new" a  seven-point ceasefire plan put forward by their southern counterparts.
Northern troops advanced in the town of Daleh, 90 kilometers (55 miles)  north of Aden, which controls one of the main routes to the former southern  capital, SABA news agency quoted him as saying.
Reports on the developments at Daleh were contradictory Friday, with each  camp claiming control of the area.
The spokesman said southern forces also suffered heavy losses at Abyane  where large amounts of weapons and ammunition, including 18 tanks and four  armored vehicles, were seized.
The rival armies of former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since May 5, shattering four years of uneasy union between the  conservative north and the Marxist south.
Arab League delegates carrying a message from the organization's Secretary  General Esmat Abdel Meguid calling for an immediate halt to the civil war were  due to meet with President Ali Abdallah Saleh on Saturday.
Friday's peace plan, proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP),  called for an immediate end to the nine-day war and the creation of a national  unity government.
But northern leaders repeated demands made at the beginning of the  conflict for southern leaders to surrender.

A woman who lost her job as a perfume demonstrator  because of alleged body odor told a court hearing her wrongful dismissal  lawsuit that the incident made people see her as "this smelly person."
Sharon Bagnall told an Ontario Court judge that she was humiliated by the  April 1991 dismissal by Calvin Klein Cosmetics.
"No one sees that I'm a wife, a mother, that I have a life," Bagnall told  Judge Lee Ferrier. "They just see this smelly person."
The Canadian subsidiary of the US-based firm maintained that Bagnall's  odor created a persistent problem for other employees.
Arguments ended Friday and a ruling was expected in June.

Defending champion Patty Sheehan  fired a three-under-par 68 at the windblown LPGA Championship Friday to breeze  into share of the halfway lead with Robin Walton.
Sheehan began the day back in 17th place, but four birdies and just one  bogey put her at two-under 140 through two rounds.
Walton's 70 included a double bogey and a bogey as well as four birdies.
The pair were trailed by overnight leader Alice Ritzman, who carded a 73  for 141.
They were the only three golfers under par after two rounds on the par 71  DuPont Country Club course.
Briton Laura Davies eagled her last hole for a 72 that put her on 142,  tied with Meg Mallon.
"The wind gusted and came from everywhere," said Ritzman, who is seeking  her first victory in 17 years on the tour. "It seemed like it changed  direction every five seconds. It was a nightmare."
The winds pushed up the cut to nine-over, the highest on the women's tour  this year.
"I shoot like this every week," Walton said. "But usually I get trashed."
Given the conditions and her own recent run of indifferent play, Hall of  Famer Sheehan ecstatic after her round.
"I'm just thrilled to death," she said. "It was probably one of my best  rounds of the year."
She got three birdies in her first five holes -- at 11, 12 and 15.
"That certainly put me in a good position, knowing I was not in danger of  missing the cut," she said. "It was the first time this year I felt in  control."
Moving to the front nine, Sheehan birdied the second, then gave one back  at eight where she left her approach short with a three-iron.
"I had a brain hemorrhage," she said. "I used the wrong club. It's as  simple as that."
While Sheehan was moving up from 17th place, overnight co-leader Dottie  Mochrie was dropping back to the same spot with a 78 for 146.
She closed with a dreadful double bogey, missing a 12-foot putt for par,  then angrily knocking the remaining two-inch putt past the hole.

Prime Minister Jean Chretien told members of his  governing Liberal Party he would continue efforts to build Canadian unity  despite the efforts of Quebec separatists.
Describing Canada as "the best country in the world, a country that is the  envy of the world," Chretien's message was seen as a critique of separatists  who want to see his native province of Quebec become an independent state.
Speaking to nearly 3,000 jubilant supporters six months after winning a  landslide election victory he said he would do "what is right for my country,  Canada ... Our challenge is to keep building this country."
Chretien offered no new policy initiatives, even though the convention is  supposedly a policy-making convention.
Instead, he stood firm on patriotic themes and rhetoric before a partisan  crowd which continuously interrupted him with standing ovations. Many  delegates broke into a chorus of the national anthem "O, Canada" when Chretien  ended his speech.
One of the standing ovations came when Chretien told delegates that he had  decided not to allow the United States carry out any more cruise missile tests  over Canadian territory after this year.
The tests began under another Liberal prime minister, Pierre Trudeau.
Once elected, Chretien said he would review the situation, but would allow  two tests already planned for this year.

Ukraine agreed Friday to adhere to guidelines  for nonproliferation of missile technology, the White House said.
Vice President Al Gore and Deputy Prime Minister Valeri Shmarov signed a  memorandum of understanding on the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR),  which the United States and 24 other nations belong to, the White House said  in a statement.
"The memorandum is a welcome expression of the strong partnership that the  United States and Ukraine have established to address issues of  nonproliferation and arms control," the statement said.
"Ukraine's commitment to abide by the the criteria and standards of the  MTCR is an important step that shows the readiness to be a responsible  national actor in the sale of high-technology goods and services, including in  the aerospace sector."
The accord bans the export of missiles or missile technology to countries  that could use it to build such weapons.

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has urged the  British government to respond positively to a document detailing demands for  clarification of the Anglo-Irish joint declaration.
The document was transmitted to the British government by the Irish  government Friday on behalf of Sinn Fein.
"Sinn Fein has a clear view of what is required to achieve a lasting peace  founded on democratic principles. We have a peace strategy aimed at moving the  situation in that direction," Adams said in a statement.
He added: "It is necessary that the replies from London to our questions  properly and honestly clarify these issues so that the peace process can be  advanced."
"It is important that the British government responds positively to this  initiative and answers the questions put to it in a direct and comprehensive  manner."
A statement issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew earlier  Friday said the British government would study and make public Sinn Fein's  demands for clarification of the December 15 Anglo-Irish declaration.
"It is clearly in the public interest for people to know what these  questions are. We shall make them public with our comments within a matter of  days once we have had an opportunity to give them proper consideration," his  statement said.
The Anglo-Irish declaration, signed in December by British Prime Minister  John Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds, offered Sinn Fein, the  Irish Republican Army's political wing, a full place in peace talks once the  IRA renounced violence -- an offer that was not definitively accepted or  rejected, pending clarification.
Sinn Fein previously insisted on face-to-face meetings with government  officials, apparently probing for resumption of the type of secret contacts it  held with British officials during most of 1993.
London, meanwhile, had hitherto refused to give any clarification, saying  that the declaration was self-explanatory.
But Mayhew hinted last month to an American congressional committee that  he would consider responding to specific queries.
Friday's exchange is likely to raise hopes that republican leaders may be  edging closer to declaring an end to their 25-year armed campaign opposing  British rule in Northern Ireland.

Canada's Paul Tracy crashed here  Friday during practice for Indianapolis 500 pole qualifying, dimming chances  of a front-row sweep by the Mercedes-powered Penske team.
Tracy spent Friday night at Methodist Hospital following neurological  tests and X-rays after he lost control of his car at 240 mph (384 km/h) in the  third turn. Tracy was listed in good condition with a concussion and bruised  left foot but is questionable for qualifying.
Record speeds and a crowd of more than 200,000 people are expected  Saturday at the 2.5-mile (4km) oval for time trials despite forecasts of  late-day rain.
Rookies Hideshi Matsuda of Japan and Canada's Jacques Villeneuve won the  first spot in the qualifying line in a blind draw. Reigning Indy champion  Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil was next-to-last in the order, just ahead of 1993  Indy pole winner Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands.
Tracy's primary car suffered extensive damage, but his backup car was  tested late Friday and could be ready if Tracy was declared fit to drive.
"Paul should be driving tomorrow," said Fittipaldi, Tracy's teammate. "We  still aren't sure what happened. But the backup car is ready. I tested it at  225 mph (360 km/h)."
Tracy, Fittipaldi and 1992 Indy winner Al Unser Jnr were favored to sweep  the front berths in the 33-car field for the May 29 race. All three Roger  Penske team drivers use the new Mercedes motor, which has extra boost over  conventional Indy-car engines thanks to a loophole in rules for this race  alone.
"I'm not a betting man, but I know who is going to get the pole," said  reigning series champion Nigel Mansell. "Penske is going to run away with it."
---
Fittipaldi has the top practice lap of 230.483 mph (368.772 km/h), with  Brazil's Raul Boesel next best at 230.403 (368.644 km/h) followed by Tracy,  Unser, Eddie Cheever, Mansell, Mario and Michael Andretti.
"If we can make the front row, it would be a real coup," said Michael  Andretti, making his Indy return after spending last season on the Formula One  circuit.
Those top drivers are aiming for the speedway records, set in 1992 by  Roberto Guerrero, of 232.618 mph (372.188 km/h) for one lap and 232.482 mph  (371.971 km/h) for a four-lap qualifying run.
"There is no more pressure-filled day in racing than pole qualifying  here," said Mario Andretti, a three-time Indy pole winner in his 29th and  final 500. "Qualifying for this race is an event in itself. It's the only race  where you have a week to get going as fast as you can just to get into the  race."
Owner-manager Derrick Walker, a former Penske chief, said he expected a  pole speed above 234 mph (374 km/h). "Jesus," said stunned driver Mark Smith  upon hearing the prediction. "I was hoping he would say 227 mph," added racer  Robby Gordon.
The fastest rookie is Villeneuve, son of the late Formula One racer Gilles  Villeneuve. He has reached 226.637 mph (362.619 km/h) in a Reynard-Ford. Other  rookies above 220 mph (352 km) are Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, Brazil's  Mauricio Gugelmin and Matsuda.
Lyn St. James, the only female driver here, reached 225.749 mph in  practice Friday, the top speed ever recorded for a woman racer.

A photographer filed a one million dollar lawsuit  against Michael Jackson Friday as a photographer claimed the pop star did  nothing to stop his bodyguards from beating him and taking his film.
Free-lance photographer Alex Oliveira alleges two Jackson bodyguards  attacked him in New York's Central Park March 31 as he tried to photograph the  pop superstar.
Oliveira filed the lawsuit in federal court, naming the bodyguards as  "John Does I and II."
According to Oliveira, one of the bodyguards told him to "give me the ...  film or I will break your neck." Then, said Oliviera, the bodyguards pushed,  choked and shoved him as they took his film and camera.
Oliviera alleged that Jackson failed to discipline, train or control his  bodyguards.
Oliviera contends he suffered severe and permanent injuries including  back, shoulder and neck pain, sleeplessness, anguish, and pychological and  emotional distress.

Ukraine has dismantled its 46 intercontinental  missiles, Interfax news agency quoted President Leonid Kravchuk as saying  Friday.
The scrapping of the SS-24 missiles was part of an agreement signed in  Moscow January by Kravchuk, US President Bill Clinton and his Russian  counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
The agreement called for the complete denuclearization of the former  Soviet republic where a total of 176 missiles, including the 46  intercontinental missiles with a range of more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200  miles) had been deployed.
The report came as Ukraine agreed to adhere to guidelines for  nonproliferation of missile technology, according to the White House in  Washington.
US Vice President Al Gore and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeri  Shmarov signed a memorandum of understanding on the Missile Technology Control  Regime (MTCR), to which the United States and 24 other nations belong, the  White House said in a statement Friday.

Nearly 100 Rwandan nurses, doctors and drivers of  the relief organization Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) have been killed in the  country's civil war since mid-April, MSF announced Friday.
The killings happened inside refugee camps, hospitals and medical centers.
An MSF team that visited the massacre sites said only 40 civilians out of  about 2,800 grouped at the Saint Joseph center at Kibongo survived a massacre  there on April 15.
The others were killed by exploding grenades, rockets, automatic arms fire  or were knifed, between 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. They were buried in a mass  grave under the bishopric's refectory later, the organization said.
A nurse who had been kidnapped and raped by army troops and beheaded,  along with two drivers and a clergyman, was among the victims.
MSF said the killings among its staff were the first since the  organization was created in 1971.
The report came as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso  made an impassioned plea Friday for the world to end the "unimaginable human  tragedy" in Rwanda.
Ayala Lasso said in Geneva the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had both  welcomed his proposal to set up a commission to determine the causes of the  massacres which have left some 200,000 dead in the tiny highland central  African state, and determine responsibility for them.

The UN Security Council delayed a vote  Friday on a plan to deploy 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda to reinforce a UN mission  reduced to 270 members.
While welcoming the US initiative to establish protected sites for  refugees close to Rwanda's borders with Burundi and Tanzania, UN Secretary  General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said concentrating on that "would be to only  address a small part of the problem" and could draw more refugees.
"I believe that it is essential that any such initiative should be matched  by action to assist persons in the interior of Rwanda," he said in a report to  the council.
After several hours of discussions, the council postponed action on the  Rwanda proposal until next week, said Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria,  the council president this month.
The proposed UN force would be composed of troops from Tanzania, Nigeria,  Ghana, Senegal and Australia, and would include 800 troops in the Rwandan  capital Kigali to protect the airport and other key sites.
But Boutros-Ghali said such a mission would be facilitated by a ceasefire  between warring factions in Rwanda, which plunged into chaos and bloody ethnic  fighting following the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana April 6 in a  suspicious plane crash.
Earlier on Friday in Paris, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the UN special  representative to Rwanda said the United Nations' top priority was a ceasefire  between rebels and government soldiers and that negotiations on other topics  would come later.
"For now, it is difficult to resume political negotiations so long as  there is no ceasefire," Booh-Booh said.
"A ceasefire is theoretically possible but certain conditions must be  fulfilled" first, he said referring to the Tutsi rebels' refusal to recognize  the transitional government set up following the death of Habyarimana.
In Geneva, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso made an  impassioned plea for the world to end the "unimaginable human tragedy" in  Rwanda.
"The world must do something to halt this violence," said Ayala Lasso  after five days in Kigali where he met with the chiefs of the Hutu-led  government army and the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front.
Ayala Lasso said the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had both welcomed  his proposal to set up a commission to determine the causes of the massacres  which have left some 200,000 dead in the tiny highland eastern African state,  and responsibility for them.
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees meanwhile said that  with US planes now operating an airbridge to take aid to some 250,000 Rwandan  refugees in Tanzania had stepped up its efforts and was flying in plastic  sheeting for shelters.
Some 2,000 refugees are continuing to cross the border each day, said  spokesman Ron Redmond.

The World Bank has approved loans for India  totaling 6.5 billion to seven billion dollars for the next three years,  officials said Friday.
The loans are less than the nine billion dollars approved for the previous  three-year period, but reflect the changing nature of the aid and improvements  in India's economy, said Heinz Vergin, the bank official in charge of India.
Bank officials noted that Indian economic growth reached 13 percent in  1992 and 1993. Inflation was 13 percent in 1993 and 5.3 percent in 1992.
Both economic growth and inflation are expected to be 10 percent next year.
The World Bank loans are no longer aimed at propping up India's currency  reserves, but financing specific economic projects, Vergin said.
In a related matter, the bank said its International Development  Association would provide a 117.8 million dollar credit to help fight  blindness in India.
The funds will allow some eight million Indians to undergo cataract  surgery between now and the year 2000, the bank said.
"This is the boldest effort yet to reduce blindness in a developing  country," said the bank's Donoso Clark. "The project's main focus will be on  restoring the sight of poor people, particularly women."
The bank said about one-third of the world's 35 million blind people live  in India, and that 40 percent of Indians blinded by cataracts were between 40  and 60 years old.
The World Bank has also funded programs to help reduce AIDS, leprosy,  tuberculosis and malaria in India, as well as several projects on child and  maternal health.

A Polynesian race many deny exists, which 150  years ago was driven to the edge of extinction by a genocidal war, might win  justice after the High Court here ruled they were entitled to seek  compensation for lost lands.
The Moriori lived on the isolated Chatham Islands, 870 kilometres (539  miles) from here, until 1835 when the Te Ati Awa Maori tribe arrived from New  Zealand and began slaughtering them.
Tommy Solomon was even referred to as the "last" Moriori when he died in  1933.
Now the approximately 200 remaining Moriori have filed a suit with a  quasi-judicial body seeking a return of lands. Moriori Charlie Preece says his  race is getting stronger and the tribunal, by agreeing to hear their land  claims, was giving them recognition as a race.
"It's taken 160 years to get this far. Now we want to do things that  should have been taken care of a long time ago," he said.
But Maoris, claiming a right of conquest and the fact that the Native Land  Court last century had refused to recognise Moriori, had gone to the High  Court seeking to stop the hearing.
The Moriori story, often marked by accusations of racism and bias, has  only rarely been debated publicly and is one of the country's darkest secrets.
Whites used to claim Moriori were a peaceful race who occupied mainland  New Zealand until the Maori arrived and exterminated them. Although there is  no evidence of Moriori populations in mainland New Zealand, this version of  history is used as a justification for the later white occupation.
But pro-Maori academics claim there was no such race as the Moriori, and  that the group living on the Chathams were simply descendants of Maori  fishermen taken by wind and tide to the islands.
Oddly, the Maori claim Moriori have no right to complain because they are  a conquered people, but such rationale on mainland New Zealand advanced by  whites towards Maori would be regarded as unacceptable.
Two years ago a joint New Zealand-Thai study of skulls revealed marked  differences between Maori and Moriori.
Whites first visited the Chathams in 1791, then occupied by an estimated  2000 Moriori. Whalers and sealers followed, bringing diseases which killed off  hundreds of Moriori.
The Moriori were known as pacifists and when word of this reached Te Ati  Awa Maori in 1835 they seized a ship in Wellington harbour and sailed to the  Chathams.
"Moriori, A People Rediscovered" by Michael King, a book published in 1990  and for the first time outlining what happened, told of around 1,400 deaths in  the wake of the Maori arrival.
One Moriori said they were taken prisoner: "The women and children were  bound, and many of these, together with the men, were killed and eaten, so  that the corpses lay scattered in the woods and over the plains. Those who  were spared from death were herded like swine, and killed from year to year."
By the 1870s there were fewer than 100 Moriori left, and the Maori Land  Court of that time held the Chathams to be Maori land, by right of conquest.

Scotland Yard detectives are to investigate the  theft of four million dollars (2.6 million pounds) from the United Nations  headquarters in Somalia, a police spokeswoman said early Saturday.
A team from the Yard's international and organised crime squad will fly to  the Somali capital, Mogadishu, early next week, said a Yard spokeswoman.
The UN called in Scotland Yard after the cash, used to pay the  international organisation's staff in the strife-torn African state, where  there are few banking facilities, disappeared from a filing cabinet at its  main compound in Mogadishu a month ago.
The spokeswoman stressed it was not unusual for international agencies to  draw upon the expertise of Scotland Yard officers in investigating crime  abroad.
But, although Scotland Yard detectives would question and possibly  fingerprint suspects, they were not authorised to make arrests, she said.

The Italian industrial group Riva said late Friday  it was pulling out of a deal to buy the giant eastern German EKO Stahl  steelworks, embarrassing the Kohl government in the region ahead of October's  elections.
Riva said it would not revise its decision "whatever new proposals are  made," the Treuhand privatisation state holding company said.
The move comes after two weeks of talks which tried to renegotiate the 100  percent buyout which was worth 1.1 billion German marks (700,000 dollars), one  of the most ambitious privatisation projects in the former communist East.
The deal came unstuck over differences between Riva and the IG Metall  union over the choice of a neutral member of the company's supervisory council  and the pace of job cuts, which would bring staffing down from 3,000 to 2,300.
The union has also questioned Riva's economic soundness.
The Treuhand said it would immediately get back in touch with investors  who had shown an interest in the company earlier.
The EKO Stahl works is a key employer in the depressed eastern German  region of Eisenhuettenstadt.

President Bill Clinton announced Friday he  plans to nominate George Bruno the new US ambassador to Belize.
Bruno, 51, is an attorney specializing in human rights issues. He was a  member of the Justice Department during president Jimmy Carter's  administration.
Bruno has degrees in civil administration and US history and has  participated as an international observer to elections in Pakistan and Romania.
Clinton also announced he intends to nominate Phyllis Oakley, a career  Foreign Service Officer to be the next assistant secretary of state for  population and refugees.
Oakley, 60, has been acting director of the department's Bureau of Refugee  Programs since March. She has also worked as the State Department's deputy  spokeswoman and has experience on intelligence, Middle East and humanitarian  assistance issues.
At the agriculture department, Clinton intends to fill two top slots.
He will nominate Jose M. Amador as assistant secretary for science and  education. He will be responsible for science, technology and education  programs. Amador is a native of Cuba. He presently heads the Texas A  M  Research Center.

Senior figures from Britain's Labour opposition  party hope their new leader will be known by mid-July, following the death of  John Smith which has devastated British politics, the press reported Saturday.
An early leadership contest could capitalise on the party's current  strength over the ruling Conservative party which, according to an opinion  poll Saturday has fallen into third place -- 21 points behind Labour and half  a point behind the Liberal Democrats.
Labour's chairman David Blunkett said the party would move "sensibly but  quickly into resolving the leadership, and the opinion appears to be we should  try and do that by mid-July."
Blunkett said the timetable for a leadership contest would be drawn up by  the party's ruling national executive at its next meeting on May 25.
Meanwhile, Britain's three main political parties have announced a  suspension of campaigning in the Europen elections until after Smith's funeral  Friday in Edinburgh, and a political truce, as a mark of respect, has called a  temporary halt to partisan attacks.
It is still too early to gauge the effect of Smith's death on Labour's  chances of success.
However, a Gallup Poll taken before his death from a heart attack  Thursday, but published in Saturday's Telegraph found nearly half of voters  think Labour will win the next general election.
In the wake of the Tories' drubbing in local elections last week, the  survey gives Labour, on 45 and a half percent, a 20 and a half point lead over  the Liberal Democrats which are on 25 percent. The Tories are third on 24 and  a half percent.
Few place all the blame on British Prime Minister John Major. Most point  the finger at the government as a whole, although only 13 percent of Gallup's  respondents think Major is "firmly in charge."
In Inverness to a Scottish Tory conference, Friday night, in a speech  recast to remove political aspects, Major indicated he had no intention of  standing down and asked: "Judge me on my whole term. All of it. You can't  judge a house when only the foundations are laid."
Editorial comment in Saturday's Telegraph analysed the current sombre  political mood: "The death of Mr Smith and Labour's prospective leadership  trauma could influence national politics in two obvious ways.
"First, the current wave of emotion may spill over into some sympathy  votes for Labour at the European elections on June 9, enlarging the party's  likely triumph.
"Yet Mr Major's prospects of retaining the Tory leadership seem  strengthened... If the government can avoid another self-inflicted crisis for  a few weeks, the Tory leadership issue may recede as public attention focuses  on the future of the Opposition."
On her first full day as acting Labour leader for the imminent  Euro-election campaign Margaret Beckett on Friday expressed confidence that  her party's leadership issue would be decided without rancour "to make sure  that his (Smith's) life's work is not frustrated by his death."
In Saturday's Daily Mirror, Beckett said she hoped the memory of Smith's  decency would change the attitudes and behaviour of all politicians.
And she pleaded for unity to continue: "He was very proud of the way the  party has pulled together. He was very proud of the sense of unity and the  will to win."
She urged her party to: "continue to display that unity and will to win...  We must all conduct ourselves so that he would have been proud of us and do  nothing that would let him down. We must do nothing that will in any way mean  that his work comes to nothing."
As to the leadership candidates, the bookies' 1-3 favourite for the job is  domestic affairs expert Tony Blair.

A Briton was flogged 50 times for breaking Moslem  drinking laws in the Gulf State of Qatar, his father said Friday.
The British Foreign Office confirmed it was looking into the case, which  is thought to be the first time a Briton has been flogged in Qatar.
Computer technician Gavin Sherrard-Smith, 30, was lashed with three-foot  canes in the jail where he is serving a six-month sentence.
The beating took place on May 3, but Sherrard-Smith's father learned it  had taken place from a letter which arrived Friday.
In a post-script, his son wrote: "PS. Got my 50 on Tuesday. All okay. Glad  it's over."
Appeals for clemency by his 72-year-old father, former colonel Derek  Sherrard-Smith failed, despite further appeals from British diplomats.
Sherrard-Smith -- who denied selling alcohol to a Moslem -- was sentenced  to 50 lashes, six months in jail and deportation after his arrest in November.
Qatar allows westerners to drink only at home and strictly controls the  sale of alcohol.

A couple from Mali was given a four-year suspended  sentence Friday by a court in the Paris suburb of Bobigny, after mutilating  their two daughters by the traditional African practice of female  "circumcision."
The prosecution had asked the court to set an example in the widely  publicised case, which would send a message to the African community.
"I was circumcised at my birth, I wanted my children to be like me,"  explained mother Dembele Soumare, aged 34, who argued that she had not known  the operation was illegal in France.
Her husband Guessouma, 54, said he was not involved in the affair which he  described as "women's business which does not concern the head of the family."
The local hospital discovered that 12-month-old Fatoumata Soumare had been  infibulated -- a ring passed through the outer lips of her vagina -- and her  clitoris removed when she was hospitalised for an anaemic condition in August  1990.
Her sister Feta, aged three, was then examined by the emergency services  who found the clitoris and smaller vaginal lips removed, typical of the ritual  circumcision practised on young girls in around 30 African countries.
Dembele, saying she had acted alone, described meeting a circumciser who  brought her to an unknown address where she operated on the children as they  sat on the mother's knee.
"I did not look at what she was doing, I do not know what instrument she  used. My girls bled very little," she told the court. The operation cost 100  francs (17 dollars).
Her husband acknowledged knowing that the operation was illegal. "If my  wife had asked me I would have told her not to do it," he said.
A witness from the childrens' inspectorate who interviewed the couple  after their arrest contradicted this testimony, saying that at the time the  father defended the operation as a normal custom.

A strong earthquake rocked the southern Philippines  before dawn Saturday, toppling power and communication lines and houses,  authorities said, with at least three people reportedly injured by falling  debris.
The temblor, which struck at 4:12 a.m. (2012 GMT Friday), registered 5.7  on the Richter scale with its epicenter just a few kilometers (miles) off the  shore of Pagadian City, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology  (Phivolcs) said.
The quake, which resulted from tectonic plates colliding, also registered  a five on the Rossi-Forel scale in Pagadian, meaning that unstable objects  would be toppled but stable structures would not be damaged.
Pagadian police, contacted by telephone, said that when the quake hit,  residents of coastal areas panicked and fled to higher ground for fear of  tsunamis -- extremely high waves -- but have since returned to their homes  when it became apparent no tsunamis were coming.
Senior police officer Rodolfo Tual said the quake "was very strong but it  lasted just a few seconds," adding that it reminded him of a major earthquake  that caused tsunamis and killed several hundred people in the south in 1976.
Power and some communication lines in the city of 110,000 were knocked out  by the quake but electricity was restored after a few minutes.
Residents of Pagadian were quoted by southern Philippine radio stations as  saying that about 43 houses made of light materials collapsed, injuring three  people. Police said they were trying to confirm these reports.
The quake was felt throughout the western half of the large southern  island of Mindanao but had no significant effects outside of Pagadian,  Phivolcs said.

Japan's main opposition Liberal Democratic Party  plans to submit a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  possibly as soon as budget bills are approved, according to party leader Yohei  Kono.
In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun published Saturday, he said that  the Hata coalition, which holds only 190 seats in the 511-seat lower house,  was formed against "the people's will."
The ruling coalition was forced to form a minority government last month  after the Social Democratic Party (SDP) withdrew its support. It is Japan's  first minority government in 39 years.
Kono hinted that the no-confidence motion might be submitted after budget  bills are passed. He said: "I think it is necessary to pass the budget bills  for the sake of people's daily life."
The bills, for the fiscal year to March 1995, are expected to be approved  during the current parliamentary session which ends June 29.
Kono, whose party is the biggest in parliament, urged the SDP to back the  no-confidence motion. He said he wanted to link up with the SDP to overthrow  the Hata coalition if the two parties could agree common policies.
The two parties, which control 280 seats in the lower house, have already  agreed to cooperate in parliament.
Hata has said he does not intend to call a snap general election if a  no-confidence motion is passed.

Japan's Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai said Saturday  that Japan could not make an exception and issue a visa to Argentine soccer  star Diego Maradona.
Maradona has been refused entry to Japan with the Argentine soccer squad  because of a drug conviction.
In an interview with Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), Nakai said, "I know  Maradona is a superstar. I know about Japan's soccer boom. But we cannot make  a special case for him."
He said Japan was conducting an anti-drug drive so could not issue a visa  to Maradona because his drug record was relatively recent.
The 33-year-old soccer player was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for  cocaine possession and charged in 1992 in Italy for drug use.
Maradona was invited by the Japan Football Association as a member of the  Argentine national team to participate in a three-nation tournament here  scheduled for May 22-29.
Japan failed to win a place in the World Cup finals, but soccer is a boom  sport with the launch of the nation's first professional football league last  year.

Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao left  Saturday on a week-long trip to the United States, where he is expected to  hold talks on the thorny nuclear issue, officials said.
The 73-year-old premier left by a special Air India plane from a military  airbase on the capital's outskirts, accompanied by a high-level delegation  that includes Finance Minister Manmohan Singh.
It is the first visit to the US by an Indian premier since Rajiv Gandhi  went to Washington in October 1987, and the most controversial of foreign  trips by Rao since he took office in June 1991.
Indian officials say New Delhi's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes  will top Rao's agenda in his meetings with President Bill Clinton and other US  officials.
Opposition leaders had pressed Rao to call off the visit to denounce what  they alleged was US arm-twisting over nuclear non-proliferation, Kashmir,  human rights and trade.
At the root of Indo-US differences is the refusal by New Delhi, which  exploded a nuclear device in 1974, to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty or agree to a pact on a nuclear-free South Asia.
The Press Trust of India news agency reported Saturday that Rao "was  expected to tell the US ... that it will not accept Washington's plans for a  multilateral meet on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia."
The US administration, which fears that South Asia is a potential nuclear  flashpoint, also wants New Delhi not to induct an indigenous  surface-to-surface Prithvi missile in the army and halt research on the  intermediate-range Agni ballistic missile.
A US proposal to supply 38 F-16 planes to Pakistan, with which India has  fought three wars and which it accuses of backing Moslem separatism in  Kashmir, has also angered New Delhi.
Indian officials said Rao, who launched a radical programme of economic  liberalisation in July 1991 ending four decades of quasi-socialism, will  invite increased US investment in India.
Rao arrives in New York Sunday for meetings with the large Indian  community there and then goes to Houston for talks with US business leaders.  On Tuesday, he will fly to Boston, where he will give a lecture at Harvard.
His two-day stay in Washington Wednesday and Thursday includes a speech to  a joint session of Congress, and a two-and-a-half-hour session with Clinton.  The two are scheduled to hold a joint press conference Thursday.
Rao is also to have talks with Defence Secretary William Perry, Commerce  Secretary Ron Brown and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

Former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa has agreed  to give testimony about his financial transactions in a bid to reopen debate  in parliament on the budget, it was reported here Saturday.
The Tokyo Shimbun, quoting coalition sources, said Hosokawa agreed to give  evidence after opposition parties still refused to join in the budget debate  until he clarified his role in a loan from a scandal-tainted trucking firm.
Hosokawa reportedly received 100 million yen (950,000 dollar) from Tokyo  Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 for campaign use.
Hosokawa resigned last month after he acknowledged that he illegally paid  no interest on the loan to the firm, which used to have ties with gangsters  and influential politicians, including former Liberal Democratic Party  kingmaker Shin Kanemaru.
Hosokawa is also alleged to have traded stocks under the name of his  father-in-law. But he has denied this.
The ruling coalition, Japan's first minority government in almost four  decades, has pledged to pass the budget bills by the end of June. Budget  debates have been stalled since early March.

TOKYO, May 14 (AFP) - IBM Japan Ltd. is to more than double its  recruitment in 1995 because it is expecting a recovery following brisk sales  of semiconductors and computers, news reports said Saturday.
The Japanese subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is  to hire about 300 university graduates next year, compared with 140 this year,  the Yomiuri newspaper said.
It is the first time in six years that the company is to boost the number  of new employees.
The newspaper said the gain was based on expectations that the company,  which suffered losses last year, planned to reap profits this year on brisk  shipments of semiconductors.
The Yomiuri also said the larger recruitment was aimed at preparing for  growing markets of multimedia-related businesses in the near future.
The company, facing severe business conditions in Japan, has restructured  and shed 3,000 employees last year.
Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. also plans to boost recruitment next year from 300  new graduates last year to 400 next year, the Yomiuri said.
The Japanese computer maker, which suffered its first ever loss last year,  also expects profits for the current year on growing demand for semiconductors  and workstations.

Australia is considering a UN request for a  contingent of troops as part of a 5,500 strong force that may be sent to  Rwanda, officials said here Saturday.
The request followed UN Security Council discussion of a US plan to send  troops to establish protected sites for refugees, although the council on  Friday postponed action on the proposal until next week.
A decision on the request would probably require the approval of cabinet  or at least the prime minister and senior ministers covering defence and  foreign affairs.
Sources here say at least 10 western countries, mostly European, have also  been asked to make a contribution along with a number of African countries if  the Security Council gives the go-ahead.
A foreign affairs department spokesman said: "I can confirm that a request  has been received from the UN in the last few hours, but no decision has been  made about it yet.
The spokesman was unable to say how many troops would be contributed.

Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has offered  to resign after legislators refused to ratify a draft accord settling the  separatist conflict in Abkhazia, a deputy said.
Legislators said they would draw up a draft of their own, different from  the one hammered out by a government delegation and Abkhazian envoys and  mediated by Russia.
Former Georgian prime minister and deputy, Tengiz Sigua, told journalists  after the parliament meeting Friday that Shevardnadze offered his resignation  as he had failed to win support for the draft.
Early Friday Georgian deputies were given a first glimpse of the draft  which is to be signed in Moscow Sunday in the presence of representatives from  the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The draft calls for a 12-kilometer (seven-mile) security zone in the Gali  region in southern Abkhazia, where Commonwealth of Independent States troops  and UN observers will be deployed, the Iprinda news agency reported.
Some deputies fear the security zone will definitely bar access to  Abkhazia from Georgia, and said the negotiated settlement was tantamount to  "surrender."
Shevardnadze stepped down for a few hours last September 14 after  parliament refused to grant him special powers to impose a state of emergency  because of the worsening crisis in Abkhazia.

At least four bombs exploded in trouble-torn  Karachi early Saturday, the official Associated Press of Pakistan said.
No casualties were immediately reported from the blasts which started when  unidentified attackers in a car hurled a bomb inside a mosque. People were  just gather for dawn prayers in the middle class Gulshan-i-Iqbal area of the  port city.
The bomb went off in the courtyard. An adjacent Islamic religious school  escaped without serious damage or injury, reports said.
Three more blasts were heard in Karachi's suburbs, police said without  giving details.
The early morning blasts followed a week of violent clashes between police  and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) in which more than 30 people were killed.
The MQM represents Urdu speaking settlers from India after the 1947  partition of the subcontinent. It has accused the administration of the  southern Sindh province of persecuting its community.
The authorities accuse the MQM, the main opposition group in the Sindh  assembly, of involvement in alleged terrorism. MQM sources said more than  2,000 people had been arrested following clashes earlier this month. It said  "false" charges had been used.

Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergei Terchenko  arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to discuss ways of implementing  economic and trade agreements.
Terchenko, accompanied by a high-level political and economic delegation  including the ministers of energy, trade and transportation, was greeted at  the airport by Vice President Hassan Habibi.
He told reporters that his visit was aimed at boosting bilateral relations  and speeding up cooperation in various fields -- including air, sea and road  transportation.
Habibi said the two countries would discuss implementation of accords  already reached during visits to Alma Ata last October by President Ali Akbar  Hashemi Rafsanjani, and to Tehran by the Kazakh leader, Nursultan Nazarbayev,  in November 1992.
An official from the Kazakh embassy in Tehran told AFP that his country  and Iran would also discuss oil cooperation.

Japan's Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. Ltd. is to write  off 400 billion yen (3.8 billion dollars) over three years to help bail out  affiliates suffering bad loans, a newspaper said Saturday.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the write offs would include 130 billion yen  it was to report in the financial year to March to support six of its troubled  nonbank institutions.
The Osaka-based life insurer, which is to suffer unexpected losses for the  time being, will suspend bonus payments for its managers and cut their monthly  salaries by up to ten percent duirng the year to March 1995, the daily said.
Sumitomo's unrealised gains on property and securities holding at the end  of March were estimated at 2,000 billion yen.

After three months of record-breaking sales  overseas, South Korea's auto exports slowed to 58,100 units in April, but were  still up  6.6 percent from a year ago, manufacturers said Saturday.
The average monthly growth of auto exports from January through March was  18.1 percent, but automakers here shipped only 84 percent of their monthly  export goal in April, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
Meanwhile, domestic sales in April jumped 14.8 percent from a year ago to  139,200 vehicles, causing delayed delivery and forcing makers to turn some of  their overseas shipments to the domestic market, the association said.
The average first quarter monthly increase of domestic sales was 7.1  percent, it said.

China has played one of its trump cards in its bid  to obtain renewal of trade privileges from the United States with the release  of Chen Ziming, a symbolic figure of the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
Chen, a 41-year-old economist, was condemned in February 1991 to 13 years  prison for "plotting against the government" and "counter-revolutionary  propaganda."
His sentence, and a similar one imposed on his friend Wang Juntao, who was  freed last month and went to the United States for medical treatment, were the  heaviest imposed on leaders of the movement, which ended with the Tiananmen  Square massacre on June 4.
Chen, described by the authorities as the "black hand" of the movement,  was freed to have medical treatment, Xinhua news agency announced Friday in a  brief five-line dispatch in its English-language service.
He contracted several illnesses while in a Beijing prison and is suffering  serious heart problems, according to his family.
"In releasing Chen on apparent humanitarian grounds, the government has  played its joker which undoubtedly will weigh heavily in Bill Clinton's  choice," said a western diplomat.
The US president must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's Most  Favoured Nation status which grants favourable access to the US market for  Chinese goods.
Washington has said renewal is linked to progress in China's human rights  record.
Chen's freedom follows the recent release of six Christian dissidents from  labour camps where they had been serving terms ranging between one and three  years.
"The authorities are not taking many political risks in releasing  opponents who are ill and a handful of Christians, and allowing some others to  emigrate," said the diplomat.
These gestures to appease Washington do not represent a change in the  government's repressive policies or an improvement in the human rights  situation, political analysts said.
Last Thursday, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin defended the bloody  repression in Tiananmen Square for the first time publicly. He said any fresh  demonstrations would be dealt with similarly.
On Friday the People's National Congress also approved the revision of the  law on public order aimed at preventing the slightest criticism of the  authorities.
A clampdown on the more active dissidents which began late last year has  intensified in recent weeks with the arrest of at least six people in Beijing  and Shanghai.
The most recent victim was Yang Zhou, spokesman for the Chinese  Association for Human Rights, arrested at his home in Shanghai.
Meanwhile, China's most famous dissident Wei Jingsheng is still under  police guard in a government residence in a Beijing suburb.
Beijing still has another card to play to win over Washington, according  to most political analysts. Bao Tong, 62, the most senior Chinese official  jailed after the 1989 demonstrations was transferred a month ago to a hospital  in Beijing because of deteriorating health.
His family said he has complained of inflammation of the thyroid, salivary  glands and lymph nodes. But he remains under police surveillance in his  hospital bed.
Bao, an economist and former top aide to disgraced Communist Party chief  Zhao Ziyang, is serving a seven-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary  propaganda and incitement."

A radical Islamic daily on Saturday protested  against a visit by a group of US newspaper editors and said it would boycott a  meeting between the journalists and representatives of the Iranian press.
The chief-editors of 13 US newspapers and magazines arrived here earlier  this week on a three-day visit to "raise their understanding of present-day  Iran," a US journalist told AFP.
They have already held several meetings with representatives of the  Iranian media and were to meet Saturday with the editors-in-chief of the press  in Tehran.
"It is not clear who invited the American editors to Iran and why the  culture ministry has arranged a meeting between them and Iranian  chief-editors," said Jomhuri Islami, a daily close to Islamic hardliners.
The paper warned that the meeting could be a "ploy" by Washington to try  and reopen talks with Iran through an indirect channel.
Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after radical students  stormed the US embassy here and took its staff hostage.
The United States has called several times for direct negotiations, but  the two sides have yet to make a breakthrough. Islamic hardliners are fiercely  opposed to any talks with Washington.

A Chinese flotilla was spotted steaming into the Sea  of Japan overnight for the first time since the end of World War II, the  Japanese defence agency said Saturday.
Four Chinese naval ships, including a destroyer and a frigate, were  believed to be on their way to the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok on a  goodwill visit, agency officials said.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported earlier this month that three  Chinese naval ships, led by Chinese northern fleet commander Vice Admiral Wang  Jing, will arrive in Vladivostok on Tuesday.
The visit will reciprocate a port call to the Chinese port of Qingtao by a  fleet of three Russian naval ships in August.
The officials said the Chinese ships included a 3,250-tonne Luda-class  destroyer, a supply ship, a submarine support and rescue ship and a  2,250-tonne frigate.

Queen Beatrix was expected Saturday to formally  appoint three party officials to negotiate a broad coalition government for  the Netherlands, thrown into political turmoil after this month's general  election.
The Christian Democrats (CDA), who have dominated the political scene for  most of this century, lost 20 seats in the vote on May 3, retaining only 34 in  the 150-seat lower house of parliament.
Their partners in the last government, the Social Democrats (PVDA), lost  12 seats but became the biggest parliamentary party with 37 seats. The  right-wing Liberal Democrats (VVD) gained nine seats, putting their tally to  31, while the left-wing Democrats '66 (D66) party doubled its score to 24  seats.
The negotiators will be Klaus de Vries for the PVDA, Gijs van Aardenne for  the VVD and Jan Vis for D66, a statement from the palace said late Friday.
De Vries, director general of the federation of Dutch local councils since  1988. A lawyer, who has worked in the justice ministry, he was a member of  parliament from 1973 to 1988.
Van Aardenne is a former minister of the economy, who was also deputy  prime minister in the first cabinet of Ruud Lubbers from 1982 to 1986.
Vis has chaired the D66 parliamentary group in the Senate, of which he has  been a member since 1980. A former journalist, he teaches constitutional law  at the university of Groningue.
If the negotiators manage to reconcile the differences between their  respective parties, they will present a final report to the Queen, who will  then decide who should be asked to form a government and possibly become the  country's next prime minister.
The left-right coalition, if it comes off, will be the first time the  Christian Democrats have been left out of power for 75 years.
Analysts said however that despite the goodwill expressed on all sides, it  would not be easy to set up because of wide differences of view on certain  issues, notably social security.
If negotiations break down, there are two possible scenarios: to bring  back the outgoing Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition with the addition of  the D66 Liberals, or an alliance between the Christian Democrats with the VVD  and D66.

India is to evacuate 15 Nepalese nationals  stranded in civil war-torn Yemen, the Indian embassy said here Saturday.
The announcement of the planned evacuation from Yemen's capital Sanaa,  follows a request to India by the Nepalese government, an embassy statement  said.
"A message has been conveyed to the Indian Ambassador in Sanaa that all  Nepalese nationals holding valid travel documents should be evacuated along  with the Indian nationals," it said.
"It is understood that the Nepalese nationals will be arriving on May 18  or 19 by the Indian ship, M. V. Nicobar in Bombay and the Royal Nepalese  Embassy in New Delhi will coordinate their further movement from Bombay to  Kathmandu," it added.

Vetaran Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda,  facing challenges from three presidential contenders in multi-party elections  on Tuesday, said Saturday his work of ruling Malawi was not yet finished.
Banda, believed to be in his 90s, said in a 20-minute speech on state  radio that the future Malawi needed an experienced leader like him.
"The future holds challenges and dangers, needed to be led by the  experienced and capable government of Kamuzu," he said.
Describing the elections as historic, Banda said Malawi needed politicians  of ability, honour and good reputation.
"MCP (the ruling Malawi Congress Party) has that ability, skill ,  integrity and experience," he said.
Banda, accused of serious human rights abuses during his three decades in  power, said his government would respect human rights and uphold good and  accountable government.
''We will limit state power by laws,'' he said.
Banda's address was his last campaign effort after cutting short his  campaign tour of the country due to a "leg problem."

The Singapore High Court has made a landmark sex  equality ruling that a house-husband can claim a share of his working wife's  property in a divorce, a report said Saturday.
Judicial Commissioner K.S. Rajah ruled Friday that the unemployed man  looking after the household was entitled to similar rights as women given  benefits in matrimonial property disputes, the Straits Times reported.
The couple, whose identity was not disclosed, had been married for 26  years and divorced last year.
The husband "housewife" demanded a a share of a flat worth 355,000  Singapore dollars (233,000 US). He was awarded 50,000 Singapore dollars.
The 55-year-old husband, described as a freelance Christian pastor, said  he cooked, cleaned the house and looked after the three children while the  wife worked.
The wife, 48, claimed she paid for the purchase of the house with her  earnings and her husband did not make any financial contribution.
In ordering the 50,000 Singapore dollar payment, the judge said he had  taken into consideration the oustanding mortage of 84,000 Singapore dollars.
The report said the husband could not be contacted as he had gone to  Malaysia. The woman told reporters she was too upset to talk about the matter.

Kuok Philippine Properties Inc., plans a stocks  rights offering and sale totalling 802.97 million pesos (28.7 million dollars)  to finance expansion and diversification, documents obtained Saturday said.
The Malaysian-Philippine real estate joint venture will offer 727.51  million pesos (26 million dollars) in stock to existing holders. An additional  75.46 million pesos (2.7 million dollars) will be sold to Eastern Securities  Development Corp., a local brokerage firm.
The documents, obtained from the official Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), did not say what Eastern Securities would do with the shares.
Proceeds from the rights offering will be used to help finance the  construction of a three billion peso (107 million dollar) office complex in  Manila's financial district of Makati.
It will also go to raising the 480 million pesos (17.2 million dollars)  necessary for the company to acquire about 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of land  just outside Manila, to be developed into a "multiuse complex," in partnership  with two other unidentified real estate firms.
The documents also said that part of the proceeds would go to the 500  million pesos (17.8 million dollars) the company needs to raise to acquire  about 20 to 35 percent in an unidentified "major food processing and  manufacturing concern."

Bangkok police arrested four young Russian women  on prostitution charges after raiding two hotels in the capital, news reports  said Saturday.
A Thai woman, Darin Chitklaew, 43, also was arrested in the raids on  Friday and charged with procurring customers, they said. Police said the  Russians had admitted travelling to Thailand in January on tourist visas to  work as prostitutes.
Bangkok police arrested four other Russian women on prostitution charges  in March.
News reports have said that more than 3,000 Russians were now working as  prostitutes here. One Thai language daily said there were more than 11,000.  But Thai officials say the influx started after the disintegration of the  former Soviet Union.
Police said the women faced a maximum fine of 1,000 baht (40 dollars) and  deportation.

Several armored cars took up positions Saturday in  the Georgian capital Tbilisi ahead of a debate in parliament on President  Eduard Shevardnadze's challenge to deputies to abolish the post of presidency.
The armored cars were reinforcing police checkpoints already in place for  several days in the center of the town, witnesses said.
Shevardnadze submitted Friday his resignation and proposed abolishing the  presidency to protest the deputies' refusal to ratify an accord towards  settling the conflict with the separatist republic of Abkhazia in western  Georgia.
Ramaz Sakavarelidze, Shevardnadze's press officer, quoted by the Georgia  news agency Iprinda said that Shevardnadze would remain parliamentary speaker,  a post to which he was elected in October 1992.
Shevardnadze has been head of state since his election in November 1992.
The deputies fear the accord will authorize the secession of Abkhazia. The  accord, to be signed Sunday by Georgian and Abkhazian delegations in Moscow,  calls for deploying Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops in a  12-kilometre (7.2 mile) security zone separating Abkhazia from the rest of  Georgia.
Georgia has been hit since becoming independent in 1991 by a series of  political crises, including two civil wars and the Abkhazian secession  struggle, at a time when the national economy is in ruins.

Iran has protested to Tokyo over the cremation of  an Iranian who allegedly committed suicide in Japan, saying it was against  Islamic law, the official IRNA news agency said.
The Iranian embassy in Tokyo lodged the protest in a letter to the  Japanese foreign ministry, it said.
A Japanese municipality said it ordered the cremation of the body "because  of the hot weather and since it could not determine the victim's identity,"  according to IRNA.
The embassy, however, said the body had been identified four days after it  was discovered and demanded that the foreign ministry open an investigation  into the case.
The body of the Iranian, who apparently committed suicide, was discovered  on May 1, IRNA said.
Thousands of Iranians work in Japan.

The Chinese authorities on Saturday followed up  the jailing of two US citizens for fraud by issuing a stern warning to  foreigners who flout the country's laws.
"Foreign businessmen who think they can do what they like in China are  wrong," said the People's Daily newspaper in a front page article, a day after  Chinese-Americans Fransisco Hung Moy and Raymond Lee, were jailed for 20 and  14 years respectively.
The pair were convicted of orchestrating a massive financial scam in which  they tricked a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, in the northern Hebei  province, out of 200 standby letters of credit worth 10 billion dollars.
"The development of a socialist market economy is accompanied by a strict  legal framework which everybody must obey," the paper said. The editorial was  headlined "A rare case, a big lesson."
Referring directly to the case of the US citiziens, the newspaper said:  "Foreigners in China must respect Chinese law just as Chinese people have to  respect foreign law," it added.
The authorities were careful not to unduly frighten off much needed  foreign investors, stressing the aim was not to shut the door on businessmen,  but to get rid of dishonest ones.
"We want to defend the rights and interests of foreign societies. Friends  from all five continents are welcome in China," the article said.

Former French minister Bernard Kouchner called on  the international community Saturday to help avert "genocide" in the  ethnically divided country.
"We cannot stand by and let genocide be perpetrated," said Kouchner, who  arrived here on Thursday and spent Friday touring orphanages and camps for  people made homeless by the five-week conflict.
Kouchner, a doctor who founded the medical charity Medecins Sans  Frontieres, told reporters the international community must shoulder its  responsibilities and address the "gigantic humanitarian problem" in Rwanda. He  is a former socialist minister for humanitarian action.
The UN Security Council delayed a vote Friday until next week on a plan to  deploy 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda to reinforce a UN mission reduced to 270  members.
Kouchner has held talks with both sides in the conflict, which flared  between the ethnic minority Tutsis and majority Hutus following the mysterious  plane crash death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6.
"I would like to persuade both sides of the need to protect civilians,  women and children," of whom 20,000 are "displaced" in Kigali, he said.
He held talks in northern Byumba with rebel leader Paul Kagame, whose  Rwandan Patriotic Front is drawn from the Tutsis, and in Kigali with the  Rwandan army chief of staff, general Augustin Bizimungu.
More than 100,000 people have been killed in the latest fighting.

Sporadic bursts of heavy weapons continued in the  Rwandan capital Saturday as rebels fighters battled government troops in an  attempt to take control of the city, United Nations sources said.
Saturday's fighting mainly involved larger weapons fired from long  distances, unlike the close range small arms duels that raged in Kigali on  Friday.
Most of the fighting, pitting the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front  (RPF) against Hutu-dominated government troops, was taking place in areas  surrounding the headquarters of the United Nations Assistance Mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR) and the road leading to the airport.
The rebels claimed on Friday that they have taken control half the country  after five weeks of heavy fighting with government forces during which tens of  thousands of people have died.
The tiny central Africa nation plunged back into a murderous ethnic war  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an alleged rocked  attack on his plane on April 6.
The UN Security Council on Friday delayed a vote on a plan to deploy 5,500  peacekeepers to Rwanda to reinforce some 400 troops now there. A decision is  expected next week.

Bosnian leaders reacted angrily Saturday to US  backing for a European peace plan giving 51 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina to a  Bosnian Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to Serbs.
Bosnian Serbs, who control over 70 pecent of the territory, for their part  rejected giving as much as 51 percent to the Bosnian Croats and Moslems.
Mustafa Bijedic, Bosnian ambassador in Geneva where the leading powers  also including Russia took their united stand late Friday, told AFP that  America had "now joined with Europe in rewarding fascist Serb aggression".
He said there were no moral or international legal grounds for giving 50  percent of a state to "an aggressor which has killed one quarter of a million  people".
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who also condemned the new  US-European-Russian stand, meanwhile met in Geneva Saturday with US Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, a US diplomat said.
The Bosnians had been hoping for Washington's support in their bid to  increase the territory to be apportioned to an agreed Bosnian Croat-Moslem  federation from 51 percent to 58 percent.
The Bosnia ambassador warned that such reward for Belgrade-backed Serb  aggression paved the way for similar support to dissatisfied minorities  elsewhere, such as Russians in Latvia and Ukraine or Hungarians in Romania.
"It could happen anywhere in the world," Bijedic said, but added that  there was "still a chance" that Europe would "think about what could happen"  and "not produce a time bomb in the Balkans".
The Bosnian Serbs Saturday said the Croats and Moslem Bosnians could not  have the 51 percent the European plan would give them, the Bosnian Serb news  agency reported.
Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament,  said they in no way had more than the Serbs "as they are neither moral nor  military victors and moreover do not possess such a proportion of territory".
"We believe that one has to take into account the situation on the ground,  namely that the Serbs control 73 per cent of the territory and that they are  owners of 64 percent," he was quoted as saying.

South Korea on Saturday aired worries over a North  Korean telex to the IAEA saying was preparing for the change of fuel rods in a  five megawat nuclear reactor without outside inspectors present.
"It is extremely regrettable that North Korea gave notice of its decision  to prepare to go ahead with the rod change on its own," a foreign ministry  statement said.
The United States has warned that Pyongyang could extract enough plutonium  from the spent fuel to make four or five nuclear bombs. Washington says it is  vital that North Korea allow inspection and sampling of the rods.
The foreign ministry statement added that South Korea hoped the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could clarify the situation when its  monitors leave for North Korea this weekend.
"We stress the crucial importance of sampling and securing the rods as  demanded by the IAEA and remind North Korea that the nuclear problem should  not be taken to a destructive phase by unilaterally changing the fuel rods."
A ministry spokesman told AFP that the wording of the telex left it "far  from clear" as to whether "they have started or are preparing to start"  changing the rods at the five megawatt experimental reactor at the Yongbyong  nuclear complex, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of Pyongyang.
"We are waiting for the IAEA report," he added.
In Vienna on Friday, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the nuclear watchdog's  inspectors, scheduled to leave for Pyongyang over the weekend, should "be able  to do most of their work, which is satisfactory for us."
Kyd added that the trip was expected to last eight days but could be  extended if necessary. He also confirmed that North Korea had responded  positively to an invitiation from the IAEA to hold talks on narrowing  differences on the scope of inspections.
In Washington, State Department spokesman David Johnson indicated Friday  that a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang hinged on the outcome of  the new IAEA inspections.
Johnson said Washington would consider setting a date for the talks after  the inspections were completed.
Plans for the third round of talks were called off when the IAEA said in  March their inspectors had not been given full access to the sites they  weanted to visit, inlcuding a crrucial radio-chamical laboratory.
North Korea contended then that the UN nuclear watchdog had tried to go  beyond its mandate.

A fire that broke out overnight in a  hostel whose residents included foreigners killed three people and left one  person missing, police said Saturday.
But police said that it was unlikely that the fire was racially motivated.  Up to 20 people lived in the hostel, but none were seeking asylum.
Police did not know the cause of the fire which destroyed the three-storey  building.
Damage was estimated at some 300,000 German marks (182,000 dollars).

Iran has denied a US newspaper report that it  secretly delivered a planeload of arms to Moslems and Croats fighting the  Serbs in Bosnia, the official news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
"The allegations by the American daily that Iran has sent arms to Bosnia  are false," the Iranian embassy in Croatia said, quoted by IRNA.
The Washington Post reported Friday that a planeload of arms was delivered  earlier this month.
But IRNA, quoting Croatian officials in Zagreb, said the load comprised of  humanitarian aid such as rice, flour, sugar and cooking oil, which was  delivered to a Moslem charity in Bosnia.
The Post, quoting Western and Moslem sources in Sarajevo, said a Boeing  747 landed at Zagreb airport on May 4 to deliver 40 containers with an  estimated 60 tonnes of explosives, detonators and raw material for mortars.
One-third of the load was allegedly delivered to Croatia and the rest  transported by government trucks to the Moslems in Bosnia.
Iran, a stauch supporter of Moslems in their battle against the Serbs in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, has lobbied hard for the Moslems to be exempted from the  UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia.

Twenty-three people were killed and several  seriously injured when a bus collided with a lorry in western Kenya late  Friday, the official Kenya News Agency reported Saturday.
The accident occurred near Bungoma after the bus left the town for Nairobi.
More than 500 people have died in road accidents in Kenya already this  year.

Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty showed he is equally at  home in the wet as on South Africa's sunshine circuit by charging into a two  shot lead in the rain-hit Spanish Open here.
The 40-year-old had to wait more than five hours to start his second round  on Friday at Club de Campo after heavy overnight rain, and more in the morning  prevented play from starting until early afternoon.
Even then, play was only possible for 30 minutes before another downpour  delayed things for another two hours -- setting the scene for a series of  evening finishes.
McNulty started at the 10th with a birdie three and two more birdies in  his first six holes saw him overtake first round leader Ernie Els of South  Africa, one of many players who were told that their second rounds would not  start until Saturday.
McNulty almost sank a 60-yard pitch to the 12th and holed from 25 feet at  the 15th before again having to return to the clubhouse when another storm hit  the saturated course.
At 7.30pm, the Zimbabwean reached the turn in 34,and  then put clear  daylight between himself and the rest of the field by making further birdies  at the 10th and 12th. He was seven under when darkness halted golf after he  had played 14 holes.
McNulty has only just returned to the European circuit after damaging  shoulder tendons while playing beach cricket with his children in Cape Town  three weeks ago.
"I fell very awkwardly diving to take a catch and landed heavily on my  right side," he said.
South African Wayne Westner was among a group of 12 players who pulled out  with a variety of injuries and strains. Westner had been sick overnight and  his explanation was quickly accepted.
But former European number one Ronan Rafferty could be fined up to 250  pounds for walking out after five holes of his second round.
"I am not going to make up an excuse," said the Ulsterman. "I just don't  want to play anymore."
Sweden's Klas Eriksson, winner of the Challenge Tour last year, was forced  out with a bad wrist, while veteran Spaniard Ramon Sota, 56-year-old uncle of  Severiano Ballesteros said: "I am withdrawing because I am too old for all  this."
Defending champion Joakim Haeggman, Sweden's first Ryder Cup player, could  have been forgiven for joining the exodus. But he battled on against poor form  which saw him take sixes at his first two par fives, making it a near  certainty that he will not make the cut.
Ballesteros, hoping for a second successive victory after his success at  St. Mellion last week, struggled to stay in touch despite making birdies at  the third and eighth to go two under par.
The Spaniard three-putted the ninth and dropped another stroke at the 10th  to return to where he began the day at level par.
The first to make sure of a place in the third round was Manny Zerman, an  Italian-born South African who was raised in Durban but now lives in the USA.
He has 73 for 143 after reporting for play at eight o'clock in the morning  but not completing his 18 holes until nine at night.

A depot stocking bombs for Russian Pacific fleet  warplanes blew up Saturday, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of  Vladivostok in far-eastern Russia, ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
Armored cars as well as a train were sent to the site to evacuate  residents from the zone and a large-scale rescue effort was underway. No  casualty or damage figures were yet available, the agency said.
The blasts at 3:40 p.m. (0440 GMT) near the village of Novonejino shook  Vladivostok, witnesses said in the agency report.
The Russian emergency ministry said there were neither chemical nor  nuclear weapons at the depot.
Officials from the Pacific fleet and a counter-espionnage team were sent  to the site to determine the cause of the explosion, military officials said  in the ITAR-TASS report.
A special team from the defense ministry left Moscow for the scene, the  emergency minstry said.

The Kremlin apartment of the founder of the Soviet  state has been shut for a year and its contents moved to his home outside  Moscow to permit renovations, the news agency ITAR-TASS reported Saturday.
Lenin's Kremlin apartment had been preserved as it was during his  lifetime, and his furniture and boxes containing 42,000 articles were moved  earlier this week to the museum at Leninskiye Gorky, the house where he died,  ITAR-TASS said.
The official order concerning the move notes that it is temporary, and  points out that government services in the rest of the Kremlin building  affected have also had to be transferred elsewhere.
But it appears unlikely that Lenin's Kremlin apartment, where he lived  from March 1918 to October 1923, will reopen to the public. The apartment  became a museum in 1955.
The move follows the closure in November of the Lenin museum at the  entrance to Red Square, leaving the mausoleum containing Lenin's mummified  body as the last place in the vicinity of the Kremlin to hold a relic of the  Soviet leader.

Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Saturday it  was time for Israel and the PLO to push ahead with negotiations on extending  Palestinian self-rule, following its launch in Jericho and Gaza.
"We must continue the negotiations without waiting, not only on extending  autonomy to other parcels of the territories, as we will do in Washington, but  also to negotiate the handover" of civilian powers, he told Israeli radio.
"It would be wrong to believe that we can be in charge of the existence of  the Palestinians in Nablus, Hebron and Ramallah," which are towns on the  occupied West Bank, along with Jericho, he said.
Peres referred to education, health, welfare and taxes.
On Friday, as Palestinian policemen took over Jericho, Deputy Foreign  Minister Yossi Beilin said Israel could withdraw totally from the West Bank  within five years.
As for Jericho itself, Peres said he was "very happy that our heart has  been unburdened of this weight."
"When I hear the relief of our soldiers who were sent to serve as targets  for young stone-throwers, I tell myself: our soldiers have been brave, but,  thank God, it's over," he said.
The foreign minister, adding his voice to scepticism already expressed in  Damascus, said he doubted US Secretary of State Warren Christopher's shuttle  mission to Syria and Israel, starting on Sunday, could produce a breakthrough.
"For the time being, Syria's proposals do not give us much hope," he said.
Beilin, meanwhile, told the US television network CNN: "I think the  American mediation is vital. We will be able to see peace between us and Syria  within months."
An official in Damascus has charged that Israel had "minimized the US role  by reducing it to a mere postman delivering the Israeli point of view without  any amendment."
Syria insists on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights,  captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Christopher is to meet Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara on his  arrival in Damascus on Sunday night, before heading the next day for Israel,  where he is expected to stay until early Wednesday.
US officials with the secretary in Geneva on Saturday also played down the  latest peace mission. "The one certainty is that there will be a lot of trips  ... It will be a long and arduous process," one official warned.
Washington, as the chief sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has  turned its attention to Syria since the signing of the Israel-PL0 accord on  May 4 to launch autonomy in Gaza and Jericho.

Italy's European policy will not be affected by the  "radical political change" in the country, whose government includes  neo-fascist ministers, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said Saturday.
In an interview with the daily Corriere della Sera, Martino said the  change since right-wing media magnate Silvio Berlusconi took over as prime  minister following March elections "does not mean a break with the fundamental  line of our foreign policy."
"It is essential that we make it understood straight away that we do not  have any intention of giving up Italy's European vocation."
He said he would meet Sunday in Brussels with Italy's ambassadors posted  to the 12 European Union countries, ahead of an EU foreign ministers meeting  scheduled for Monday.
Martino is also due to hold talks in Brussels on Monday with European  Commission President Jacques Delors.
The Italian foreign minister intends to fly to Washington afterwards to  meet US leaders for talks focusing on preparations for the July 8 Group of  Seven summit of the world's leading industrialised nations in Naples.
Pressed on Italy's European policy, the minister said it would be based on  "an active policy in support of a political Europe, which is absolutely  necessary."
"Europe must find a way of speaking with a single voice on foreign policy  and must reach a common defence," he said.
Martino, who is close to Berlusconi, renewed criticism of the fixing of  exchange rates during the move towards a single European currency by a target  date of 1999.
"I am not anti-European when I criticise an excess of intervention on  markets. I would also like to recall that an excess of directives (from the  EU) make Europe appear in the eyes of public opinion as another level of  regulation which is superimposed on that of the nation.
"And that leads to a reaction of rejection," he said.

Austrian Formula One driver Karl Wendlinger  remains in a stable condition after his crash on Thursday, doctors said here  Saturday.
One doctor, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said that the trauma  suffered by Wendlinger's brain "appeared stable" following a scan at Nice's  university hospital where the driver, still in a deep coma, is being treated.
But there appeared grounds for cautious optimism, as the doctor added: "He  has come through the first 48 hours after the accident -- during which the  chances of neurological deterioration are at their highest.
"But it remains highly likely that there will be major functional  after-effects.
He added there is also the risk of complications arising from the coma --  an infection and/or breathing difficulties.
Wendlinger's family and fiancee, along with members of his Sauber-Mercedes  team, have been taking turns to stay at the driver's bedside.
The Austrian crashed during a practice session for Sunday's Monaco Grand  Prix, two weeks after Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed in  accidents at the San Marino Grand Prix.

Riot police Saturday stopped 400 South Korean  students from attacking the homes of two former generals-turned presidents  facing action for alleged involvement in the military supression of a 1980  civil uprising.
Scuffles lasted half an hour in heavy rain after hundreds of riot police,  armed with tear gas, stopped the students some 200 meters from the homes of  Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo, who live in the same area.
"Punish the main culprits of the Kwangju massacre," shouted students  trying to push their way through columns of police. Many carried iron pipes  but did not use them.
The demonstration came on day after dissidents filed a civil petition   urging prosecutors to investigate the two former presidents on charges of  insurrection and homicide.
In addition to the petition, veterans of the uprising have filed a suit   against the two, and 33 former military officers on the same charges, accusing  them of killing many innocent citizens in a bid to seize power.
The two former presidents led generals in the military-controlled  government in 1980. Chun became the nation's president the year following the  uprising in the southern city of Kwangju, and Roh succeeded him in 1988.

The Chinese government will increase aid to the  100 million poorest people, whose plight has been worsened by the country's  economic miracle, according to Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering.
"The living conditions of the poor may be worsening for a time due to  inflation," the China Daily quoted the minister as saying on Saturday.
He added that financial and material aid to the poor would be a government  priority for the next five years, but emphasised that inflation would "also  make the government's social relief more difficult."
Inflation has risen 20 percent since the start of the year and in some  cities is runing at more than 30 percent. The gap between poor and rich  regions is growing ever wider in a country that officially has only 30 million  people living below the poverty level, fixed at 200 yuan (23 dollars) a year.
As the number of beggars and homeless increase with each new liberalising  reform of the economy, the government is fully aware growing poverty could  cause social and political instability.

Fierce artillery battles raged Friday between  Bosnian Serb forces and the Bosnian army in the Vares region in northern  Bosnia, a UN spokesman said Saturday.
UN troops in the Nordic battalion on the scene reported nearly 300  detonations and heavy automatic weapons fire near Vares, 40 kilometres (25  miles) southwest of Tuzla, French Major Eric Chaperon, UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) spokesman said.
At Dastansko, three kilometres east of Vares, 13 mortar shells and 17 tank  mortars were fired from positions controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian  army, Chaperon said. A further 265 detonations were reported from Bosnian  territory, provoked by Serb artillery fire, he said.
In another incident, six British UN troops had been held for several hours  at a Serb checkpoint and stripped of their weapons, ammunition and personal  effects, Chaperon said.
He said it occurred at Rogatica, 35 kilometres (20 miles) east of  Sarajevo. The soldiers were on their way to Gorazde in three vehicles.
They were allowed through the Serb checkpoint at Rogatica without any  problems, but then stopped a few kilometres further on and turned back to  Rogatica, where their weapons, ammunition and personal belongings were taken  off them, including their cameras, Chaperon said.
Then the captain of the convoy was forced by the Serbs to read a statement  in front of a camera apologising to the Serbs for having gone through the  checkpoint too quickly, even though Chaperon said the convoy had been  authorised to pass.
At Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, mortar shells were fired Friday evening from  the north of the Moslem enclave, on the limit of the three-kilometre  (1.8-mile) exclusion zone imposed by NATO on Bosnian Serbs.
Fighting was also reported Friday evening just north of the Bosnian  capital Sarajevo. Chaperon said 10 self-propelled grenades had been fired and  heavy machine gun and light weapons fire was heard for around two hours on the  front line separating the Bosnian army and Serb forces.
Chaperon said Viktor Andreev, the UN civil affairs coordinator, paid a call  on Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in his stronghold of Pale on Friday  afternoon to hear his excuses. Andreev was also due to go to Pale again on  Sunday to clarify rules governing the passage of UNPROFOR convoys through  Serb-controlled Bosnian territory.
Meanwhile the spokesman for the UN High Committee for Refugees, Kris  Janowski, reported that two Saudi aid workers had been missing since May 8 in  the region of Mount Igman, around 20 kilometres from Sarajevo.
The two men, whose names were given as Chafik M. Ayadi and A. Moulehi,  were identified as members of the Muwafaq organisation.
They were last seen at an UNPROFOR checkpoint at Pazarici, at the foot of  the mountain, in Bosnian territory, he said.
After the checkpoint the road to Sarajevo becomes an earth track where it  is very easy to stray into Serb-controlled territory.

US President Bill Clinton is to meet visiting Irish  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds in Indianapolis on Saturday afternoon to  discuss Northern Ireland, officials in Dublin announced.
Reynolds, who arrived in the United States on Friday, had not been  scheduled to meet any members of the US administration during his trip, which  is essentially concerned with trade, until he received the last-minute  invitation from Clinton.
Reynolds met businessmen in Chicago on Friday and was to have been the  guest of an American university on Saturday.
He will make the trip to Indianapolis, but it was not known what time he  would meet Clinton or how long the meeting would last.
It will be the leaders' second meeting in less than two months. Clinton  invited Reynolds to Washington on March 17.
The Irish government on Friday transmitted a document to London detailing  demands for clarification of the Anglo-Irish joint declaration from Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams on Friday urged the British government to  respond positively to the request, saying: "It is necessary that the replies  from London to our questions properly and honestly clarify these issues so  that the peace process can be advanced."
A statement issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said the  British government would study and make public Sinn Fein's demands for  clarification.
Reynolds is due to fly back to Dublin on Sunday.

Some 77 civilian casualties were reported by  hospital staff here Saturday after nearly two hours of heavy weapons fire  traded by rival Afghan factions battling for and against President Burhanuddin  Rabbani.
According to a defence ministry official there was no infantry offensive  by the coalition rival forces of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek  General Abdul Rashid Dostam during the bombardment late Friday.
However, pro-Rabbani troops on the frontline in the old city based close  to Dostam's Bala Hissar fortress said they came under strong attack by Uzbek  frontline troops.
These particular pro-Rabbani troops, stationed in the otherwise deserted  ruins of Shor Bazaar receive the brunt of rival faction military pressure  because close quarters fighting is a daily occurance here even when it is  quiet elsewhere on the frontlines.
Kabul was notably quiet Saturday with no reported incidents on the  frontlines apart from the usual minor skirmishing, and the heavy weapons of  both sides also remained still.
Fighting continues in the provinces 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of  Kabul around Baghlan and Pul-i-Khumri centres which are under siege by  Rabbani's strongman ex-defence minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
"There is no change in the general military situation there," a defence  ministry official said.
Despite earlier defence ministry claims that the old city of Baghlan had  been captured by Masood's men a week ago it seems all of Baghlan is still in  the hands of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction and their Uzbek and Ismaelia  religious sect allies.
Defence ministry officials are adamant, however, that Kunduz -- which fell  briefly to Dostam in February -- and all surrounding districts are totally in  the hands of pro-Rabbani forces.

Vietnamese state firms unable to pay their debts  will soon be brought before special economic courts, a directive from the  prime minister published Saturday said.
Insolvent state companies which fail to pay up by July 1 will face the  courts under a bankruptcy law introduced last year, Premier Vo Van Kiet's  order published in the Party daily Nhan Dan said.
He appealed to beleaguered firms to "speed up the repayment of their debts  in order to reestablish financial discipline and create normal conditions for  the operation of state enterprises."
Under the new bankruptcy legislation, state firms must settle debts they  have incurred, even if it means digging into their assets and capital to do so.
Company heads who flout the law are liable to both judicial and  administrative sanctions.
The directive also applies to companies which have already been disbanded.
State and foreign creditors are owed nearly a billion dollars, according  to official statistics. So far endebted firms have paid back only 50 million  dollars.
A radical restructuring of the public sector in Vietnam has halved the  number of state enterprises to 6,000 over the last four years.

Bosnian leaders reacted angrily Saturday to US  backing for a European peace plan dividing Bosnia, viewing it as a reward for  Serb aggression, but Serbs also rejected the proposed territorial division.
The plan endorsed by the United States, Russia and five west European  states in Geneva late Friday would provide 51 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina to  a Bosnian Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to Serbs.
Bosnian vice-president Ejup Ganic said: "They (the leading powers) want us  to achieve a peace settlement and at the same they want us to swallow the  results of ethnic cleansing. Those two things are contradictory."
He said the Geneva meeting participants did not deny the London conference  principle of rejecting territorial gains made by force.
"Now they say: go in the direction of 51 percent/49 percent, which of  course will not produce results," Ganic said.
Asked whether the Moslem Bosnians were ready for new negotiations within  two weeks as the Geneva meeting urged, Ganic declined to answer directly but  said: "We are being squeezed by the international community".
He said the 51 percent for Croats and Moslems did not provide enough place  for the people concerned, and he warned of the dangerous precedent of giving  into aggression.
"If you legitimize ethnic cleansing and genocide then of course it means  that you given a green light for similar cases to start somewhere else," Ganic  said.
However he found "interesting" the Geneva meeting's call for a cessation  of hostilities with the withdrawal of heavy artillery. "I think that this is  something we will look carefully at and that we will negotiate with the  Serbs," he said.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who also condemned the new  US-European-Russian stand, met in Geneva Saturday with US Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.
Despite a bitter complaint from Silajdzic that Friday's stand amounted to  "rewarding pure force", Christopher said Saturday that the Bosnian premier  seemed to understand the US point of view.
"I told him we were doing everything we could to ensure that a reasonable  settlement is achieved for the Bosnian government. He seemed to understand  that point of view," Christopher said.
The two are due to meet again Sunday.
The secretary of state, speaking after also meeting Saturday with Russian  Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, revealed that in their meeting Friday the  foreign ministers considered the possibility of calling a special summit to  cap the Bosnian peace process.
The Bosnian Serbs Saturday said the Croats and Moslem Bosnians could not  have the 51 percent the European plan would give them, the Bosnian Serb news  agency reported.
Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament,  said they in no way have more than the Serbs "as they are neither moral nor  military victors and moreover do not possess such a proportion of territory".
"We believe that one has to take into account the situation on the ground,  namely that the Serbs control 73 per cent of the territory and that they are  owners of 64 percent," he was quoted as saying.

The Patriarch of All Russia Metropolitan Aleksei II  left Moscow on Saturday with a delegation of officials from the Russian  Orthodox church for a five-day official visit for former Yugoslavia.
The patriarch, who was invited by the Serbian Orthodox church, said before  leaving that he considered his visit "a peace mission aimed at ending the  bloodbath in former Yugoslavia."
The Russian delegation will visit Serbia, Montenegro and  Bosnia-Hercegovina, in particular the capital Sarajevo.
Meetings are scheduled with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the  president of the rump Yugoslav republic, Zoran Lilic, but none with Bosnian or  Croat leaders figure on the delegation's official programme.

Germany's Michael Schumacher stamped his authority  on a free practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix on Saturday, although the  race remains overshadowed by the crash involving Karl Wendlinger.
The Austrian is in a deep coma after Thursday's smash, the latest  nightmare faced by Formula One after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Schumacher has won all three races this season, including San Marino,  which was re-started after Senna crashed. But the death of the Brazilian  triple world champion looks to have ended all interest in this year's title  race.
Hugely talented and driving the best car in the championship, Schumacher  now has no serious rival for the crown.
McLaren-Peugeot and Ferrari are also likely to win races this season, as  could the late Senna's teammate at Williams-Renault, Damon Hill, but there is  little doubt that Benetton-Ford will get the top prize.
Schumacher was nearly half a second faster than Finland's Mika Hakkinen,  at the wheel of the McLaren, as they went through their paces on this  legendary street circuit Saturday morning.
Gerhard Berger, who has done much to mobilise drivers over safety in the  last fortnight, and will be a leading figure in the newly-formed Grand Prix  Drivers Association, set the third best time in a Ferrari.
Hill was fourth, fellow Briton Mark Blundell fifth in the Tyrell-Yamaha  and Berger's French teammate Jean Alesi was sixth fastest.
The last official practice was scheduled later in the day.

South African Airways (SAA) will stop its  weekly flight to Lisbon in September as part of a rationalisation programme,  the national carrier said in a statement Saturday.
SAA said the Lisbon route was no longer viable and that the last flight to  the Portuguese capital would depart from Johannesburg on September 2 and would  return the following day.

The Irish consul in San  Francisco, Declan Kelly, is to be prosecuted for drunken driving and causing a  traffic accident, in which five people were hurt, prosecutor Arlo Smith said  Saturday.
Kelly went through a red light and hit several vehicles in the accident,  which happened here on May 5. He refused to undergo a test for alcohol,  invoking his diplomatic immunity.
A blood sample taken in hospital after the accident for medical reasons  showed that his blood had more than twice the level of alcohol than the legal  limit.

Palestinian policemen were  deployed Saturday in Jabalia after Israeli troops withdrew under the cover of  night, to the delight of the Gaza refugee camp where the intifada was born.
"Jabalia, the camp of the revolution, has been liberated," cried Awad  al-Mamduh, whose brother was killed in the uprising against Israel's rule of  the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
A new contingent of 240 policemen, recruited from Palestine Liberation  Army (PLA) units in Sudan, marched into the Strip late Saturday from the Rafah  border crossing with Egypt.
At 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), the Jabalia refugees jumped for joy to see that  Israeli troops had just pulled out of the base set up in the heart of the camp  in 1970 as well as from an administration building in the neighbouring village.
As the sun rose, most of the camp's 75,000 residents and the 25,000 in the  village took to the streets to celebrate. A dozen of them scaled the army's  30-metre (yard) tower to hoist the Palestinian red-green-white-black flag.
A four-year-old child, seeing a policeman for the first time, took fright  and burst into tears, "They're not Jews, they're Palestinian soldiers," his  mother reassured him.
As hundreds of people watched from rooftops, women banged on drums and  chanted nationalist songs, a policeman in olive-green uniform saluted and  hugged another child.
Militants of the Fatah Hawks of PLO leader Yasser Arafat fired off  celebratory rounds of gunfire in the air. Even Hamas, the Islamic militants  who oppose the self-rule deal with Israel, shouted slogans to welcome the  police.
"My son didn't give his life for nothing. He died for Palestine, and I'm  so happy that they're gone," said Um Iyad al-Ashkar, wearing a pendant with a  photograph of her son who was killed by Israeli soldiers in February 1988.
"But my joy will not be complete until all the (Jewish) settlers leave our  land and Jerusalem is ours again," she said.
Mamduh voiced pride at Jabalia's long history of resistance. "In 1970, we  started resisting the occupiers. We didn't let up during 80s, and it was here  that the intifada all started."
On December 9, 1987, a day after four Palestinians were run down and  fatally injured by an Israeli truck driver, residents of impoverished Jabalia  took out their fury on the army's base.
A young Palestinian was shot dead and several other deaths followed,  before the uprising spread to the rest of Gaza and the West Bank. Israeli  bullets have claimed the lives of more than 1,250 Palestinians in the intifada.
"Who would have believed that the Israelis would leave our land when only  yesterday they were still hitting us," said Um Said, a 45-year-old woman,  commenting on the last clashes before the police deployment.
During the night, after a HAMAS attack in which two soldiers were shot and  wounded, the army burst into several homes, roughed up five Jabalia residents  with their batons, and fired tear-gas, according to Palestinian sources.
Soldiers took souvenir photographs of each other in action, while  enforcing the last night-time curfew, they said.
With the latest Palestinian deployment, almost 1,500 policemen have now  entered the Strip, where the south of the territory has now been completely  evacuated by the army.
After police took over the West Bank town of Jericho on Friday, the rest  of Gaza is to be handed over by next Wednesday.

Alan Rudolph, director of the "Moderns,"  paid tribute Saturday to US movie legend Robert Altman for producing his new  film, hours ahead of its official premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.
Presenting "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" in the official  competition, Rudolph told a press conference: "His fingerprints are all over  this. He's the guilty one. Leave me out of this."
Altman, who has a retrospective of his work showing at the 47th  International Film Festival, produced Rudolph's latest offering, about  maverick US novelist Dorothy Parker.
Altman was not at the press conference, but Rudolph indicated that the  director, whose films include the 1970 Cannes Golden Palm winner MASH, was on  his way and would be at the premiere Saturday evening..
The film, also starring Campbell Scott and Matthew Broderick traces out  the life of the notorious alcoholic at the heart of the literary and  intellectual world of 1920s New York -- the vicious circle of the title.
Mixing black and white and colour -- unusually, with the latter used for  flashbacks -- the movie had been widely compared with Rudolph's 1988 film "The  Moderns," about the US intellectual and literary world in 1920's Paris.
Rudolph starkly rejected the comparison. "I don't think this film has  anything to do with "The Moderns" quite frankly," he said. "I think that's an  easy comparison because they're both in the Twenties."
But he said "The only thing they have in common apart from me is that they  were both shot in Montreal."
Rudolph, 50, strongly defended the independence of his films -- often  accused of eccentricity -- against the more mainstream US film industry. "Kill  a guy, tell a joke, that's how to make a hit in America," he scorned.
Jennifer Jason Leigh in the title role was preparing for her second  premiere in three days -- she played a hard-hitting journalist in the US film  that opened the festival Thursday, "The Hudsucker Proxy."
Asked about playing Parker, who tried on several occasions to kill  herself, she said: "Being inside her mind was a painful experience, but I wish  I was still making the movie."
Above all though Rudolph paid tribute to Altman. "When someone of that  calibre says they like something ... you think well maybe I'm doing it  alright," he said.
"He's not a good producer," he said. "He's a great producer."

A depot stocking bombs for Russian Pacific fleet  warplanes blew up Saturday, shaking the far eastern city of Vladivostok some  100 kilometres away and triggering the evacuation of the nearest village.
ITAR-TASS news agency reported that the 3,000 residents of the village of  Novonedzhino were being evacuated. Several were hurt by broken glass and were  taken to hospital, but no deaths were reported.
Armored cars as well as a train were sent to the site to evacuate  residents from the military zone about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of  Vladivostok in far-eastern Russia.
Military officers and their families also live at the base, but the number  of residents there was not known.
The news agency said that communications were currently impossible with  the base which was sealed off by police and the army.
According to the news agency Interfax, the explosions triggered fires in  the nearby forest.
Witnesses told ITAR-TASS that the blasts at 3:40 p.m. (0440 GMT) shook  Vladivostok.
The Russian emergency ministry said there were neither chemical nor  nuclear weapons at the depot.
Officials from the Pacific fleet, including Rear Admiral Igor Khmelnov,  the fleet's first deputy commander, and a counter-espionnage team were sent to  the site to determine the cause of the explosion.
A special team from the defense ministry left Moscow for the scene, the  emergency minstry said.
Exactly two years ago, a fire caused by negligence triggered a series of  explosions at a Pacific fleet weapons stockpile in a Vladivostok suburb.
Several people were killed and 6,000 residents were evacuated amid the  fires which raged for more than two days, destroying munitions depots and  fleet facilities.

After basking in almost three weeks of  historic glory which saw the death of apartheid, South Africans took a final  break this weekend before getting back to work and school Monday.
Big business and schools turned a blind eye to two and a half weeks of  disruption that included four public holidays and spontaneous and organised  parties country-wide after South Africans voted overwhelmingly on April 26-29  for Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC).
Celebrations reached a crescendo on Tuesday when Nelson Mandela took the  oath in front of an auspicious array of world leaders to become the country's  first democratically-elected president.
But the party is now over, and for Mandela's new multi-racial government,  this means facing the awesome task of providing the country's 2.5 million  unemployed with jobs and building 2.5 million houses for the homeless.
It also means tackling the vast discrepancy in quality of education  between the country's minority whites and majority blacks. At the end of 1993  about 40  percent of black pupils passed their final year examinations,  compared to 96 percent of whites.
In an editorial headlined "At the end of it all we're on our own," the  Star newspaper said: "The pitfalls of the future lie in ... how South Africa  extends the means by which it gives all its citizens their place in the sun.  Addressing the majority's aspirations will require more than a political  solution; the new South Africa will live or die by the economic decisions it  takes."
Selby Tindleni, a schoolteacher and ANC worker in the townships  surrounding Cape Town, said Saturday that the day after Mandela's inauguration  unemployed people were queueing up outside town council offices demanding jobs.
"They say Mandela has promised them jobs and they want them now," he said.  "We need to explain to them that these things take time."
With the demise of white-minority rule, aid of up to five billion rand  (1.3 billion dollars) is poised to pour into South Africa, the Star newspaper  said.
But, it cautioned in a front-page story, the first 1.7 billion rand (472  million dollars) promised over the next 12 months is nowhere near enough to  lift an economy trying to emerge from a five-year recession.
It is half the sum South Africa borrowed from the International Monetary  Fund at the end of last year -- funds used to bolster foreign exchange  reserves which, despite the injection, plummeted by 3.2 billion rands (888  million dollars) in the first four months of 1994.
"Aid dents the pride of the nation and promotes a poor work ethic," the  Star article said. "In short, the entire country has to get back to work -- to  work hard, efficiently and assiduously."
A starting point to provide jobs, education and training, the newspaper  said, is to enhance South Africa's economic growth rate to five percent this  year, from a predicted three percent.
The requirements appeared to be in place to achieve this: Relative peace  means foreign investment is ready to enter the conomy, inflation remains in  single digit figures and the end of the recession is in sight.
And black pupils were Friday ordered by four influential education bodies  to go back to school after weeks of disrupted lessons.
In a joint statement the National Education Co-ordinating Committee, the  South African Democratic Teachers Union, the Congress of South African  Students and the South African Students Congress said: "Now that we have  achieved our liberty, the time has come for all learners and educators to  apply themselves with dedication."

Taiwanese police Saturday smashed a major drugs  ring when they arrested seven people suspected of smuggling 150 kilograms of  heroin worth 188.6 million US dollars into the country.
The seven -- five Taiwanese and two Singaporeans -- are accused of  trafficking in heroin they brought into Taiwan from Thailand, police said.
Police in the southern city of Kaohsiung swooped on some of the Taiwanese  suspects as they allegedly peddled the drug at their homes, while the others  were seized in a a bowling alley in the city.
The Taiwanese include suspected heroin wholesaler Chou Chih-kang, 43, and  a woman, Chang Wei-lun, 19.
The two Singaporeans -- Tan Guan-hsiou, 37, and Hok Wei-min, 26 -- were  arrested in Taipei, police said, adding that 38 kilograms of heroin were found  in the seven suspects' homes.
The Singaporeans claimed they were hired by a Hong Kong man to smuggle the  drug three months ago.
The seven were sent to the district prosecutor's office for charges to be  filed.
Taiwan usually imposes life sentences in jail and the death penalty on  drug smugglers and traders.

India's central bank on Saturday kept interest  rates unchanged but cut commercial banks' lendable resources, in a bid to  fight double-digit inflation.
"It is a tight monetary policy," Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor  Chakravarthy Rangarajan told reporters here after announcing monetary and  credit policy for the first half of fiscal 1994-95, which began in April.
"The paramount objective would be to ensure a sharp reduction in the  inflation rate by about four percentage points over the present level," he  said. Inflation is currently hovering at around 11 percent.
Rangarajan said the cash-reserve ratio, the amount of money commercial  banks are statutarily required to keep in reserve, had been raised from 14 to  15 percent. The lending and deposit rates were unchanged at 14 and 10 percent.
The RBI chief said high foreign capital inflows had fuelled the current  inflationary spiral, the worst since the 1991 hike to 17 percent before New  Delhi launched its market reforms.
"The present credit policy has been drawn up against the background of a  very difficult situation when both inflation and money supply are up," he said.

French bank Credit Lyonnais intends to make Asia a  priority region for expansion, its president Michel Renault, said here  Saturday.
Renault, who is on a visit to China and Vietnam, said: "We want to develop  the volume of our operations here." The Credit Lyonnais president said his  firm wanted to challenge commercial and merchant banks.
He has already discussed extending Credit Lyonnais's network in China. The  bank has offices in Tianjin, Shanghai and Xiamen and main offices at Beijing,  Shenzhen and Guangdong.
"We are waiting for permission for more, the quicker the better," said  Renault.
Credit Lyonnais is the only foreign bank with Vietnamese offices in Hanoi  and Ho Chi Minh City and on Saturday, Renault met with deputy Prime Minister  Tran Duc Luong and other senior Vietnamese government officials.
"Vietnam has its qualities even if it has been the subject of too much  attention in recent years," he commented.

The IAEA said Saturday that North Korea had "begun  preparations" for changing fuel rods at a controversial nuclear reactor and  warned that inspectors would cut short a visit if the operation had reached a  "critical stage."
The inspectors are due to leave Vienna for Pyongyang on Sunday in order to  be Tuesday at the Yongbyong nuclear complex, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of  Pyongyang, International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman David Kyd said  Saturday.
He said the inspectors would ascertain whether "North Korea has just  proceeded with normal preparation measures" to change the fuel rods in the  five megawatt nuclear reactor, "or whether they are already at a critical  stage" by removing seals on the fuel.
"If the North Koreans are already at the critical stage, the IAEA  inspectors will be recalled to Vienna, but if the work is normal, the  inspectors' work will continue," Kyd said.
South Korea on Saturday aired worries over North Korea's telex to the IAEA  saying Pyongyang was preparing for the change of fuel rods without outside  inspectors present.
"It is extremely regrettable that North Korea gave notice of its decision  to prepare to go ahead with the rod change on its own," a foreign ministry  statement said.
The United States has warned that Pyongyang could extract enough plutonium  from the spent fuel to make four or five nuclear bombs. Washington says it is  vital that North Korea allow inspection and sampling of the rods.
The foreign ministry statement added that South Korea hoped the IAEA could  clarify the situation when its monitors leave for North Korea this weekend.
"We stress the crucial importance of sampling and securing the rods as  demanded by the IAEA and remind North Korea that the nuclear problem should  not be taken to a destructive phase by unilaterally changing the fuel rods."
According to Kyd, the trip was expected to last eight days but could be  extended if necessary. He also confirmed Friday that North Korea had responded  positively to an invitation from the IAEA to hold talks on narrowing  differences on the scope of inspections.
In Washington, State Department spokesman David Johnson indicated Friday  that a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang hinged on the outcome of  the new IAEA inspections.
Johnson said Washington would consider setting a date for the talks after  the inspections were completed.
Plans for the third round of talks were called off when the IAEA said in  March their inspectors had not been given full access to the sites they  weanted to visit, including a crucial radio-chemical laboratory.
North Korea contended then that the UN nuclear watchdog had tried to go  beyond its mandate.
Kyd said Saturday that the inspectors, leaving to examine the  radio-chemical laboratory, were not scheduled to inspect the reactor.
But he said they "will have access to the five megawatt reactor to  undertake maintenance work, including notably changing batteries and film."
"There they would see whether the reactor is in the same state as in March  or whether the North Koreans have removed the seals" on the fuel, he said.

The Bosnian Moslem government and Bosnian Croat  representatives Saturday marked their agreement to set up a federation in  Bosnia-Hercegovina with a ceremony in the presence of US Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.
Also present at the ceremony in the US embassy in Geneva, and representing  the government in Zagreb, was the Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic.
Christopher said the federation agreement, which has been negotiated  step-by-step over the last two months in Bonn, Vienna and Washington under the  auspices of special US envoy for ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman, was "already  paying dividends" in terms of peace and humanitarian relief.
Croat and Moslem Bosnian forces, which had been allied against Serb  forces, began fighting last year, particularly in central Bosnia for control  of the Hercegovina town of Mostar before talks on the federation agreement  began to take serious shape.
Christopher said guns had been silenced over a distance of 200 kilometres  (120 miles) and supply lines opened up to allow in humanitarian relief, thus  alleviating the suffering of thousands of people.
"A framework has been established for protecting the political and human  rights of the people who live in the federation borders. These are truly  significant accomplishements.
"Where there was war and suffering there is now the promise of peace and  democracy. The darkness of the inter-ethnic strife is slowing giving way to a  glimmer of reconciliation."
The US secretary of state, playing tribute to the role played by Croatian  minister Granic in reaching the accord, said it provided the basis for  regional cooperation and was a first step toward lasting peace in  Bosnia-Hercegovina.
But this would require patience, goodwill and recognition on all sides  that the interests and future of people in the region, especially that of  children, could only be secured by sincere, prolonged and difficult  negotiations, Christopher said.
He said the message of the ceremony was that peace could be achieved and  the life of people improved through negotiations. He congratulated Bosnian  premier Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zupac and the  Croatian foreign minister.
Originally, a formal signing ceremony had been expected in Geneva Saturday  for the federation agreement.
But an accord upon it reached in Vienna earlier in the week provides the  federation with 58 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina territory.
This stands in contrast with a European peace plan for the former Yugoslav  republic endorsed late Friday in Geneva by the US and Russia which gives the  federation only 51 percent.
The parties in the federation have said they would like the Bosnian Serbs  to join in too, but they have shown no interest so far. In its present form it  lays the framework for relations between the Bosnian Moslem and Croat  populations in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.

Japanese organisers started a race against time on Saturday to find a  replacement for Argentina in the Kirin Cup.
"We are negotiating with countries which have friendly ties with the  Japanese Football Association," an association spokesman said.
Officials have until Monday night to find a replacement because of the  time needed to obtain entry visas, he said.

Deadly errors that led to a string of fatal air  crashes have plagued the US armed forces even as the Pentagon prepares to  release results of an inquiry into one of its most embarrassing blunders, the  downing of two US helicopters in northern Iraq by US fighters.
Twenty-six people died during an April 14 international protection force  mission when US air-to-air missiles slammed into two Blackhawk helicopters  flying across the Kurdish zone of Iraq.
The Pentagon is expected to announce in mid-May that the pilots of the two  US F-16 fighters confused the Blackhawks with Soviet-made Iraqi Hind  helicopters.
Three weeks earlier, on March 23, twenty-three people were killed at Pope  Air Base in North Carolina when an F-16 and a C-130 cargo plane landed by  accident on the same runway.
Less than one week before the Pope crash, a C-130 gunship heading out of  Kenya on a mission to support the US withdrawal from Somalia crashed into the  sea, killing seven. Pilot error was likely the cause, according to preliminary  reports.
The General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress,  released a separate report criticizing the lack of training for US Air Force  Reserve officers. In addition, the GAO said the reserve fleet is composed of  aging aircraft.
The report comes at a time when the Pentagon is relying more and more on  the reserves to offset its main force losses stemming from budget cuts.
According to James Hessman, an editor of the military magazine "Sea  Power," the annual Pentagon budget cuts could hurt training and preparation  levels.
"All the nation's armed services have been deferring, downgrading, or  selectively abandoning modernization programs essential to future readiness,"  said Hessman.
A report submitted to Congress at the beginning of the year, however, said  that the armed forces remained relatively well prepared but "less than in the  past."
The 1995 budget proposal reflects the preoccupation of the new secretary  of defense, William Perry, with concerns about biting into funds earmarked for  training and equipment upgrades.
Funding for this modernization was up 92.9 billion dollars out of a total  Defense Department budget of 263.7 billion dollars in 1995, 4.9 billion  dollars more than 1994. The 1995 fiscal year begins October 1.
For the Pentagon, this should help to implement the "Bottom Up Review," a  major Defense Department study conducted last year to chart budget  requirements if the Pentagon wanted to be prepared to conduct two Gulf  War-sized operations simultaneously.
The ability to conduct such operations is not necessarily assured,  however. Air force officials acknowledged recently during congressional  hearings that troop transport problems could arise under such circumstances.
The author of the report, defense specialist John Collins, said it would  be practically impossible to support two campaigns at once. He added it would  already be difficult to respond to a regional conflict without the help of US  allies.
Moreover, the fact that only one of four bombs carried by an US F/A-18 hit  its target and exploded during an April 11 NATO raid over Bosnian Serb  positions is particularly disquieting. Of the other three, one bomb would not  release and two hit without exploding.
"The defense industrial base as a whole could become the Department of  Defense's Achilles heel," said Hessman.
Above all, according to Collins, the focus put for many years on  peace-keeping missions, the war against drugs or humanitarian assistance, have  forced the armed forces to put more of their training and modernization funds  into financing these operations.
This was the case with Somalia and Bosnia, and the 300 million dollars  allocated for 1995 peacekeeping operations does not seem to hint at any shift  in this trend.

Passengers travelling South African Airways  (SAA) will face a barrage of greetings in at least four languages, in keeping  with the new South Africa, the national carrier said in a statement Saturday.
In the bad old days of apartheid South Africa, travellers on SAA were  addressed in two languages, Afrikaans first and then English.
From Saturday, four days after Nelson Mandela's inauguaration as the  country's first democratically-elected president, passengers will be greeted  in English first, then Afrikaans, then Zulu and Sotho. And on international  flights "a greeting appropriate to the country of destination or origin" as  well, SAA said in a statement.
"It is important that SAA be accepted by its diverse passengers," SAA  chief executive Mike Myburgh said in the statement.
"We are excited about the rebirth of a new South Africa and we must align  ourselves with the evident change and with international acceptance now that  we have become part of the world market again."
SAA was also busy scraping the old orange, blue and white South African  flag off all its aircraft and replacing it with the new, predominantly black,  green and gold one.

A battle raged Saturday between rival army units in  the strategic region of Daleh as hopes faded for Arab League mediators to  secure a ceasefire in Yemen's civil war.
The north, rejecting a southern ceasefire plan, said troops loyal to  President Ali Abdallah Saleh also captured the town of Al-Musaymir, northwest  of the south's stronghold of Aden.
The south had suffered "heavy losses."
In Daleh, 90 kilometres (55 miles) down the road from the port city,  northern forces were mopping up the last pockets of resistance and making  further advances, Sanaa said.
Southern military officials said their warplanes were mounting raid after  raid on the Daleh region, where correspondents saw seven northern soldiers  dead on the side of the road, just five kilometres (three miles) from the  village.
On Friday, the mountain village itself was almost deserted apart from  southern soldiers, they said. Hundreds of residents have fled to Aden.
The two sides have not issued a casualty toll since the war erupted on May  5, although the north said Monday that 74 of its troops had been killed and  more than 200 wounded. A Scud missile Wednesday on Sanaa claimed 25 more lives.
Clashes were also taking place in the Abyan region, east of Aden, but  fighting had eased in Kharaz, on the coast 120 kilometres (75 miles) to the  west of the city.
The south has said the war between Saleh's troops and the forces of Vice  President Ali Salem al-Baid, was being waged on five fronts.
On the diplomatic front, an Arab League delegation has been here since  Thursday waiting to see the president and deliver a call from the League's  secretary general, Esmat Abdel Meguid, for an immediate ceasefire.
A northern spokesman in Sanaa said the meeting was finally likely to take  place on Saturday.
But a source at the organisation's Cairo headquarters said the League was  not expected to make any headway because both the south and north had  toughened their positions.
The ruler of Bahrain, Emir Issa ibn Salman al-Khalifa, Saturday joined the  ceasefire calls and urged Yemen's rival leaders "to allow reason to prevail."
The south put forward a seven-point ceasefire plan on Friday, calling for  the creation of a national unity government, but it was swiftly rejected by  the north as "nothing new."
Sanaa demands the surrender of southern leaders, accusing them of seeking  partition, four years after Yemen was unified.
A spokesman in Sanaa told AFP the north demanded the surrender of the "war  criminal" Baid and "all those responsible for the war, so that they can be  judged for war crimes."
Baid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) proposed the two armies should separate  and be "withdrawn to the positions they held before the war."
The YSP plan also called for prisoner releases, for the rights of  political parties to be recognised and that "the lives, goods and rights of  citizens be protected."
In the latest evacuation of foreigners, more than 200 nationals of the  former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow on a flight out of Moscow, the  Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said.
The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619 Filipinos, including 40  children and six pregnant women, were still waiting evacuation from Yemen.

Police blocked off the Georgian capital Tbilisi  Saturday as parliament debated a controversial peace accord with the  separatist republic of Abkhazia.
Some 7,000 police were in the streets as well as blocking entry and exit  to the city, an interior ministry spokesman said. Interior Minister Shota  Kviraia directed the "anti-crime" operation personally, he added.
Police had by late morning seized more than 30 automatic arms and pistols.
Several armored cars had taken up positions earlier Saturday, reinforcing  police checkpoints already in place for several days in the center of the  town, witnesses said.
President Eduard Shevardnadze submitted Friday his resignation and  proposed abolishing the presidency to protest the deputies' refusal to ratify  the accord towards settling the conflict with breakaway Abkhazia in western  Georgia.
The deputies fear the accord will authorize the secession of Abkhazia. The  accord, to be signed Sunday by Georgian and Abkhazian delegations in Moscow,  calls for deploying Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops in a  12-kilometre (7.2 mile) security zone separating Abkhazia from the rest of  Georgia.
A Shevardnadze spokesman said Saturday that the president did not intend  to resign but to examine proposals by deputies to adopt a purely parliamentary  government system.
Ramaz Sakavarelidze, Shevardnadze's press officer, quoted by the Georgia  news agency Iprinda said that Shevardnadze would in any case remain  parliamentary speaker, a post to which he was elected in October 1992.
Shevardnadze has been head of state since his election in November 1992.
On September 14 last year, he resigned for several hours to protest  parliament's refusal to give him full powers.
Georgia has been hit since becoming independent in 1991 by a series of  political crises, including two civil wars and the Abkhazian secession  struggle, at a time when the national economy is in ruins.

French film hearthrob Alain Delon, 58, has had an  operation for a hernia, his film producer friend Norbert Saada said Saturday.
Delon, whose screen career spans more than three decades, starred in films  including "Is Paris burning" in 1965, and more recently "Un Amour de Swann" in  1984.
He is due to leave hospital on Sunday. He was admitted Tuesday after  complaining of stomach pains.

Russian orthodox church Patriarch Aleksy II  arrived from Moscow on Saturday with a delegation of church officials for a  five-day official visit to the former Yugoslavia.
"I hope to meet all parties to the conflict in this region and wish to see  a quick end to the blood-letting and suffering of innocent people," he said on  landing.
The patriarch, invited by the Serbian Orthodox church, said earlier in  Moscow that the visit was "a peace mission aimed at ending the bloodbath."
The Russian delegation will visit Serbia, Montenegro and  Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Meetings are scheduled with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the  president of the rump Yugoslav republic, Zoran Lilic, but none with Bosnian or  Croat leaders figure on the delegation's official programme.
Russia has been a traditional ally of the Serbs, who are fellow Slavs and  orthodox Christians.

The IAEA said Saturday that North Korea had "begun  preparations" for changing fuel rods at a controversial nuclear reactor and  warned that inspectors would cut short a visit if the operation had reached a  "critical stage."
The inspectors are due to leave Vienna for Pyongyang on Sunday in order to  be Tuesday at the Yongbyong nuclear complex, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of  Pyongyang, International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman David Kyd said  Saturday.
He said the inspectors would ascertain whether "North Korea has just  proceeded with normal preparation measures" to change the fuel rods in the  five megawatt nuclear reactor, "or whether they are already at a critical  stage" by removing seals on the fuel.
"If the North Koreans are already at the critical stage, the IAEA  inspectors will be recalled to Vienna, but if the work is normal, the  inspectors' work will continue," Kyd said.
South Korea on Saturday aired worries over North Korea's telex to the IAEA  saying Pyongyang was preparing for the change of fuel rods without outside  inspectors present.
"It is extremely regrettable that North Korea gave notice of its decision  to prepare to go ahead with the rod change on its own," a foreign ministry  statement said.
The United States has warned that Pyongyang could extract enough plutonium  from the spent fuel to make four or five nuclear bombs. Washington says it is  vital that North Korea allow inspection and sampling of the rods.
US Defense Secretary William Perry said late Friday that the threat of  confrontation with North Korea could come to a head within a few weeks.
"In many ways Korea poses poses the greatest security threat to the United  States and the world today," said Perry.
"We have to regard the situation as very serious," he added.
The South Korean foreign ministry statement added that it hoped the IAEA  could clarify the situation when its monitors leave for the North this weekend.
"We stress the crucial importance of sampling and securing the rods as  demanded by the IAEA and remind North Korea that the nuclear problem should  not be taken to a destructive phase by unilaterally changing the fuel rods,"  said the ministry.

Black rival political groups buried the  hatchet Saturday at the Western Areas gold mine outside Johannesburg, where  seven miners have died in clashes in the past month, owners Johannesburg  Consolidated Industries (JCI) said.
JCI chief Kennedy Maxwell, quoted in the daily Citizen, said  management-led talks produced an agreement on a code of conduct, the setting  up of a committee of inquiry into the incidents and security arrangements  acceptable to all.
Seven people died in three and a half weeks of political tension between  supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African  National Congress (ANC) at the gold mine west of Johannesburg.
Mine engineer John Brownringgs told the newspaper that work would start up  Saturday. No independent confirmation was immediately available.
Security forces under the new government moved swiftly Thursday to prevent  further clashes at Western Areas and confiscated up to eight tonnes of  homemade and traditional weapons from the mine hostel, Frans van Rensburg, a  spokesman for JCI said earlier this week.
Trade union officials said politically motivated fighting between IFP and  ANC supporters started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first  all-race elections.
They said one person was killed on April 17, two others died in fighting  during the April 26-29 poll and four were killed Wednesday.
Nelson Mandela's ANC won the election, ending more than 300 years of  white-minority rule.
Because most miners stay in large hostels accommodating thousands of  people, ethnic and political differences often boil over and result in  violence.
In one of the worst incidents, four miners were killed Wednesday in an  underground battle in the mine's south shaft between workers armed with axes  and picks before security forces moved in to help restore order.
About 9,500 miners were on strike Friday after defying a court order  Thursday that ordered them back to work at the Kloof gold mine near  Carletonville, 50 kilometres (32 miles) west of here.
The owners of the Kloof mine, Gold Fields, estimated production loss since  the strike began on May 5 at around 25 million rands (6.8 million dollars) and  Friday ordered the strikers to return to work by Sunday.
Workers had downed tools eight days ago following the dismissal of a trade  union leader for allegedly intimidating workers during a strike in March.

Thousands of tribesmen have poured into the  north western Pakistani town of Malakand to press demands for the enforcement  of Islamic law in the region, witnesses said Saturday.
Reciting Koranic verses and chanting slogans they started a sit-in which  they said would not end until President Farooq Ahmed Leghari announced the  enforcement of Sharia (Islamic) laws in the tribal district of the North West  Frontier Province.
Witnesses said thousands of demonstrators started filling the small town  from Thursday after their May 11 deadline expired. By Saturday the number had  passed 20,000 with more joining, reports said.
The tribesmen blocked a 20-kilometer (12 miles) of roads. They are living  in tents on hills and plains while many have put up plastic sheets to shelter  from rain and cold winds in the mountainous terrain, witnesses said.
The rally was organised by the Tehreek-i-Nifaz Shariat (TNS - Movement for  the enforcement of Shariat) formed in 1990.
TNS leader Soofi Mohammed told reporters he believed the government would  accept the demand.
Police and paramilitary troops were on the alert. But though no trouble  had been reported officials would not comment on the situation in Malakand.
TNS sources said the president had promised to consider their demand for  enforcement of Islamic penal code but no decision has been officially  announced.
The campaign followed a supreme court verdict in February abolishing  special regulations under which the region of Malakand, Swat and Buner was run  by the NWFP government.
The former states were merged in the provincial administration in the late  1960s. Prior to the merger the region had special Moslem courts which used to  decide local disputes on the basis of Islamic laws.
The tribesmen were unhappy at the Provincially Administered Tribal Area  regulations used after the merger. They expressed resentment at powers given  to local administrators. They also oppose federal laws put in place as a  result of February's supreme court verdict but not yet implemented.

Former Palestinian prisoners  toured the empty Israeli jail here Saturday as their new police force met  local dignitaries on the first full day of deployment in Jericho.
Apart than mounting joint patrols with Israeli border troops outside the  town, there was little active duty for the police. And with administrative  offices closed, a holiday atmosphere took hold of the West Bank town.
"Today we are resting and distributing the new posts," said Major Ahmad  Abou Hamida. "We are cleaning up the place and we will be ready for full work  in a couple of days."
Essam Mahmoud, a 35-year-old who was jailed here in 1988 toured the prison  with other former inmates. "I wanted to see my old cell ... I can't believe  that now I can enter here without handcuffs," he said.
Another former detainee, 40-year-old Ahmad Umtar, pointed to a cell's  white-washed walls. "There were all our names on the walls here. Now they're  all gone."
"I came here today with feelings of anger at the Israeli injustice and  brutality. I wanted to see this old place. I now hope all of Palestine will be  liberated."
At the new Palestinian headquarters, the former offices of Israel's  military administration, senior police officers met local dignitaries to  discuss the details of self-rule and the changes to come.
Police were on alert at the gates after a child killed himself by accident  there in the midst of celebrations Friday by firing a gun that happened to be  loaded. A woman and an elderly man were also injured in the accident.
In an investigation by the self-rule authorities, the officer who owned  the gun was being questioned and would be punished for negligence if found  guilty, said Mohammad Shaker, in charge of public relations.
As the euphoria which greeted the transfer of power a day earlier eased,  Jericho residents mingled with the policemen.
Small groups of people crowded around to exchange stories at police posts,  and cars driving in from the rest of the West Bank stopped to shake hands with  forces at an informal checkpoint.
Palestinian policemen were also deployed Saturday in Jabalia on the Gaza  Strip after Israeli troops withdrew under the cover of night.
With the latest deployment, almost 1,500 policemen have now entered the  Strip, where the south of the territory has been completely evacuated by the  army. The rest of the Strip is to be handed over by next Wednesday.

The media here blasted the British government  Saturday for refusing to comment on the alleged bugging of the Iranian embassy  in London, saying its silence acted as proof of the "act of espionage."
Tehran said Wednesday that a listening device had been found inside a wall  at the Iranian embassy in London about two weeks ago. Britain has refused to  comment on the affair.
The affair dominated media headlines Saturday with papers of every  political persuasion as well as the official agency IRNA criticising London.
Kayhan, a daily close to Islamic hardliners, called the discovery of the  device "a scandal" and criticised the British government for its "ambiguous  silence."
A conservative daily, Resalat, meanwhile urged the government to punish  Britain by reconsidering its political and economic ties.
"The Iranian nation cannot see Tehran have warm economic relations with a  country which conspires against it," it warned.
Iranian deputy foreign minister for European Affairs, Mahmud Vaezi has  said workers found the battery-charged device while tearing down a wall in  Iran's new embassy building.
But Iran decided not reveal the discovery pending further investigation,  he added.
He said Tehran had sought explanation from London, but stressed that the  discovery would "weaken relations with Britain.
Iranian president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has charged the device's  discovery led Britain to "fabricate the baseless story" over alleged Iranian  links with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), to avoid embarrassment over the  issue.
In late April London accused Tehran of having contacts with the IRA and  summoned Iranian charge d'affairs Gholamreza Ansari to the Foreign Office to  demand that any contact with the provisionals should cease.
Tehran has called on Britain to provide proof of its allegations.

North Korea said Saturday it had begun changing fuel  rods on a controversial nuclear reactor before the arrival of International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.
"As is known, the replacement of fuel rods has begun at our five-megawatt  experimental nuclear power station according to its operation plan," a North  Korean foreign ministry spokesman said.
In an inteview with the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) monitored here,  the spokesman said the IAEA had baulked at sending inspectors to observe  refuelling operations at the plant while demanding samples from the fuel rods.
"Under such conditions, we had no choice but to remove seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman was quoted as saying  by the official news agency.

A hand grenade was lobbed into the courtyard of a  Shiite mosque in Karachi on Saturday in an attack police said appeared to be  linked to friction between rival Moslem groups.
No-one was reported injured, but officials said security had been  tightened to prevent an outbreak of new sectarian violence.
The southern port city, still recovering from violence that has seen 30  deaths, was jittery amid reports of four bomb blasts around dawn.
But police denied the report by the official Associated Press of Pakistan.  They said blasting in a nearby stone quarry might have been mistaken for bomb  blasts.
The mosque attack appeared linked to friction between groups from the  minority Shiite and majority Sunni Moslem communities. But police said they  had no immediate clue as to the identity of the attackers.
Last month, five people were injured when a grenade exploded in another  Shi'ite worship place.
Apart from the sectarian trouble, the city of over 10 million people has  been hit by ethnic violence. The 30 deaths were in clashes between police and  Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM).
MQM represents the large Urdu-speaking community of people who migrated  from India after the partition of the sub-continent in 1947.
The party has accused the government victimizing the Mohajir people, an  allegation denied by the authorities.
The army has been deployed throughout Sind province, of which Karachi is  capital, since June 1992 to reduce the crime rate and control ethnic and  sectarian violence.
The MQM contested last October's elections to the provincial legislature,  taking 27 seats in its urban strongholds of Karachi and Hyderabad.
The MQM is at loggerheads with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's ruling  Pakistan People's Party. Several MQM leaders, including four senators and the  leader of the opposition in the Sind, Assembly are currently in detention.
The MQM claims more than 2,000 of its supporters have been arrested from  Karachi alone.

The director of Madrid's Prado museum, Francisco  Calvo Serraller, announced Saturday he was resigning over a dispute with  Culture Minister Carmen Alborch on the commercial use of a gallery.
Calvo Serraller, 46, made the announcement in a letter published by the  daily El Pais. He had been museum director since October 22 last year.
He clashed with Alborch for allowing the gallery containing Velasquez'  masterpiece "Las Meninas" to be photographed for a fee of 80,000 pesetas (600  dollars).
The photographs were for a furniture magazine on which Calvo Serraller's  wife is an editorial adviser.
Calvo Serraller maintained that the museum rules permit the commercial use  of galleries, but the minister said earlier this week that she did not agree.

Formula One driver Karl Wendlinger remains  stable after his crash on Thursday, with doctors now encouraged by the  Austrian's condition here Saturday.
Wendlinger crashed during a practice session for Sunday's Monaco Grand  Prix and is currently in a deep coma, with swelling around the brain.
Professor Dominique Grimaud, head of the intensive car unit at Nice's  Saint-Roch university hospital, said Wendlinger's condition was "still stable.
"There has been no aggravation of the clinical indicators, but an oedema  of medium density remains."
Grimaud, sounded a note of optimism though when he described the  Austrian's state of health as being "an encouraging stability -- but nothing  more."
Another doctor, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said: "He has come  through the first 48 hours after the accident -- during which the chances of  neurological deterioration are at their highest."
Wendlinger's family and fiancee, along with members of his Sauber-Mercedes  team, have been taking turns to stay at the driver's bedside.
The Austrian crashed two weeks after Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger  were killed in accidents at the San Marino Grand Prix.

The Jewish community and the press on Saturday united  in denouncing the police for incompetence in their handling of a  racist-inspired manhunt in the east German town of Magdeburg.
"I do not understand how this could have happened. It is a scandal that  the police did not manage to protect these people," the president of the  central council of Jews in German, Ignatz Bubis, told the daily Express in an  interview.
The Cologne daily, Koelnische Rundschau, reflected the sentiment of many  newspapers when it asked: "Who is in charge of patrolling Magdeburg? The  police or nightwatchmen?"
Last Thursday, Father's Day in Germany, when married and single men  traditionally indulge in drinking bouts, turned sour when gangs of skinheads  banded together to hunt down immigrants in the former East German town of  Magdeburg.
Around 50 youths, armed with sticks and knives, turned on a group of  Africans, before launching a full-scale manhunt through the streets. According  to police up to 150 youths took part in the incident, in which only three  people were injured.
Criticism of the local authorities has been all the harsher because the  local department of public prosecutions has since freed all but one of those  arrested.
"We cannot for the moment prove that they were involved," prosecutor  Rudolf Jaspers said on Saturday. "All those taken in for questioning  maintained that they were only spectators."
"It was like being back in the worst era of the SA (the main Nazi militia  up to 1934)," the government official responsible for immigrants and foreign  workers, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen said, who saw the events in Magdeburg as a  "horrible climax" to the xenophobic violence, which has flared in Germany  since reunification.
"This manhunt marks a new level of violence," according to Klaus  Hurrelmann, a professor at the university of Bielefeld and expert on  extreme-right movements.
Since unification in 1990 dozens of people have been killed, victims of  right-wing violence ranging from attacks on immigrant hostels in Rostock to  arson attacks in Moelln and Solingen on the homes of Turks, in addition to  almost daily isolated assaults on foreigners.
"I cannot conceive how the police allowed these criminals to go after only  checking on their identities," said Bubis, who has often spoken out against  what he sees as laxity on the part of the authorities in dealing with the  extreme-right.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, in response to public  outrage at seeking a band of skinheads attack foreigners in broad daylight  with impunity, has called an emergency meeting of the committee on legislation  in the lower house on Monday.
It is proposing that police be given powers to hold suspects in custody  for longer without pressing charges and for stiffer penalties for those  convicted of racist attacks.
But it could run into opposition from the Liberal FDP, which maintains  that existing legislation is sufficient as long as it is firmly implemented.

Canada's Paul Tracy, among the  Indianapolis 500 pole favorites, was declared medically unfit to drive here in  Saturday's time trials.
Tracy suffered concussion and a bruised left foot in a practice crash on  Friday and spent the night at Methodist Hospital.
Tracy was among three drivers using the Mercedes engine which has  dominated practice speeds this week over the 2.5-mile (4km) Indianapolis Motor  Speedway oval.
Doctors conducted neurological tests and x-rays on Tracy overnight and  ruled Saturday morning he was not yet ready to drive. His condition will be  re-evaluated Sunday.
Under Indy 500 qualifying rules, only qualifiers on the first day can  compete for the pole. Later qualifiers, even with faster speeds, must start  behind first-day qualifiers in the May 29 race.
Tracy skidded through the third-turn wall at 240 mph (384 km/h) on Friday,  hitting the outer wall of the fourth turn. He lost consciousness momentarily  during the crash, which caused extensive damage to his Mercedes-powered Penske  car.
A backup car has been prepared and tested, but forecasts of rain for  Sunday make it unlikely Tracy can make the field before next weekend's final  qualifying sessions.

Thailand's Rattanapol Sor Vorapin retained his  International Boxing Federation straw-weight title on Saturday after knocking  out challenger Roger Espanola.
Rattanapol floored the ninth-ranked Filipino in the sixth round of the  scheduled 12-round bout in the central Thai province of Saraburi.
In his sixth title defence, Rattanapol dominated the fight from the start  with strong left and right hooks to the body and face, while Espanoya managed  only occasional right hooks and light left jabs to his opponent's face.
Rattanapol improved his fight record to 18 wins, including 13 knockouts,  one draw and two losses. Espanola's record now stands at 15 wins, including 10  knockouts, one draw and two losses.

North Korea said Saturday it had begun refuelling a  controversial nuclear reactor before the arrival of inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
"The replacement of fuel rods has begun at our five-megawatt experimental  nuclear power station according to its operational plan," a North Korean  foreign ministry spokesman told the official Korean Central News Agency.
The spokesman said the IAEA had refused to send inspectors to observe the  refuelling operation at the Yongbyong plant unless the fuel rods could be  sampled. Such tests would reveal the extent of North Korea's nuclear bomb  capability.
"Under such conditions, we had no choice but to remove the seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman was quoted as saying  by the news agency, monitored in Tokyo.
IAEA inspectors were due to leave Vienna on Sunday and arrive in North  Korea on Tuesday.
Agency spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna earlier that North Korea had  begun "preparations" for changing fuel rods at Yongbyong. He warned that the  inspectors would cut short the visit if the operation had reached a "critical  stage."
The North Korean official said "refuelling is taking place under the watch  of the cameras installed by the agency. So, there are no grounds for concern  about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another purpose."

Troops loyal to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh   have captured the key town of Daleh, north of Aden, after several days of  fierce fighting, correspondents said Saturday.
Local and foreign journalists taken to Daleh, which lies 90 kilometres (55  miles) from the southern stronghold of Aden, confirmed it was held by northern  troops.
Northern military officials said they captured the town on Friday.
Daleh controls a key position on the road to the main southern air base.  Several days of fighting around the area has forced residents to flee, seeking  safety in Aden.
With the loss of Daleh, the south called Saturday for the Arab League to  intervene to stop 10 days of war between rival northern and southern troops,  Aden Radio said.
The Council for the Coordination between Parties and the Masses,  Organizations and Nationalists in Aden sent a message to the League urging it  to protect "towns and citizens against all acts of aggression," it  said,  monitored by the BBC.
The League should intervene to see that a reconciliation accord signed in  Amman in February between the two parties is implemented, it added.
An Arab League delegation has been in Yemen since Thursday trying to  broker a ceasefire between Saleh and his southern rival, ousted vice-president  Ali Salem al-Baid.
A seven-point peace plan put forward by the southern Yemen Socialist Party  on Friday was swiftly rejected as "nothing new" by northern leaders.

Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky said  Saturday he wanted to show ordinary Russians' struggle to come to terms with  post-Soviet capitalism in his entry for the coveted Golden Palm award at the  Cannes Film Festival.
Konchalovsky, presenting "Kurochka Riaba" (Riaba My Chicken) ahead of its  premiere here later Saturday, said the film reflected the widespread crisis  created by the switch to a market economy after 70 years of communism.
"Freedom sometimes bears unexpected fruit," he told a press conference,  describing his tale of a small village in the middle of Russia rocked by the  encroachment of capitalist values.
"Everyone thought that the end of communism, or totalitarianism was  fantastic ... the fall of the Berlin Wall and so on, it provided great hope,"  he said.
"Then suddenly it isn't working," he added.
The film, a witty mixture of gritty realism and quasi-surreal fairy tale,  focuses on the fate of Assia, a staunch party member gradually converted to  the power of money.
This is brought about first by her affection for a fellow villager who  builds himself a woodcutting factory, making lots of money and increasingly  cutting himself off from the rest of the village.
Then, in a fantastical turn of events Assia, played by Inna Churikova,  discovers a golden egg apparenty layed by her constant companion, her chicken  Riaba. The whole village soon gets to hear of the treasure, and the film takes  off from there.
It comes nearly 30 years after Konchalovsky's "Assia's Happiness," made in  1967 but kept from public screenings for nearly 20 years by the Soviet  authorities.
Konchalovsky meanwhile went to the United States where he pursued his  directing career, before returning to his home country -- at least for  film-making purposes -- in recent years.
Explaining his feelings on the society he found upon his return,  Konchalovky explained: "We are in the 15th century politically speaking ...  it's not that we are savages, that's just the way it is."

German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Saturday  called on European Union states to offer economic aid to Croatia and speed up  moves to seal an association treaty with the former Yugoslav republic.
Efforts to secure peace in the war-torn Balkans should be rewarded, Kinkel  added, an apparent reference to Croatia's role in persuading its Bosnian Croat  allies to form a federation with Moslems in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina.
"I am going to work to ensure that the European Union resumes economic and  financial cooperation with Croatia," Kinkel said in a statement released by  the foreign ministry here.
"The parties at war (in the former Yugoslavia) must recognise that efforts  towards peace must be rewarded," he said, adding that "aggressors cannot count  on receiving any support in the rebuilding of their country."
Germany has long been an ally of Croatia and has held secessionist Bosnian  Serbs responsible for the two-year conflict which has torn the former Yugoslav  republic apart.
The German minister said he would call for Croatia to receive aid under  the EU's Phare development scheme for central and eastern European states, and  press for "negotiations on a treaty of association (between Croatia and the  EU) to be relaunched."
Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the European Union from  Greece on July 1.
In Geneva, the Bosnian Moslem government and Bosnian Croat representatives  Saturday marked their agreement to set up a federation in Bosnia with a  ceremony in the presence of US Secretary of State Warren Christopher but fell  short of signing a document..
Also present at the ceremony in the US embassy in Geneva, and representing  the government in Zagreb, was the Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic.
Originally, a formal signing ceremony had been expected in Geneva Saturday  for the federation agreement.

English football legend Bobby Charlton could  become national coach to Sierra Leone, according to the sports minister of the  west African state, Charles Mbayo.
Mbayo announced on Saturday he had sacked all the coaching staff of the  national squad "with immediate effect", following their first round  elimination from the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia during March.
"Leone Stars' performance fell hopelessly short of expectations," Mbayo  said, adding: "It was a national disgrace and severe blow to our pride.
"It is time to rehabilitate our national pride and restructure the team  for future participation."
The minister announced an "arrangement to secure the services of former  England captain, Bobby Charlton who is expected here in two weeks' time".
The side had previously been coached by Egypt's Mohamed Mustapha Abdel  Ghali and Sierra Leone's Obi Metzger.

Germany's Michael Schumacher will start from the  front in Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, although the race remains overshadowed by  the crash involving Karl Wendlinger.
The Austrian is in a deep coma after Thursday's smash, the latest  nightmare faced by Formula One after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Out of respect for Senna and Ratzenberger, the drivers were set to leave  the front row clear on Sunday, starting a line further back.
Schumacher, who has won all three races this season, stamped his authority  on Saturday's final official practice in the Benetton-Ford.
The German was nearly a second faster than Finland's Mika Hakkinen, at the  wheel of the McLaren-Peugeot, as they went through their paces on this  legendary street circuit.
Gerhard Berger, who has done much to mobilise drivers over safety in the  last fortnight, and will be a leading figure in the newly-formed Grand Prix  Drivers Association, set the third best time in a Ferrari.
The late Senna's teammate at Williams-Renault, Damon Hill, will start on  the second row of cars alongside Berger, whose French teammate Jean Alesi will  start on the third with Brazil's Christian Fittipaldi in the Footwork Ford.
Hugely talented and driving the best car in the championship, Schumacher  now has no serious rival for the crown in the wake of Senna's death.
McLaren-Peugeot and Ferrari are also likely to win races this season, as  could Hill but there is little doubt that Benetton-Ford will get the top prize.

Troops loyal to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh   have captured the key town of Daleh, north of Aden, after several days of  fierce fighting, correspondents said Saturday.
Local and foreign journalists taken to Daleh, which lies 90 kilometres (55  miles) from the southern stronghold of Aden, confirmed it was held by northern  troops.
Fighting was reported to be going on south of the strategic town, as  northern troops continued their push towards Aden.
Northern officials, who said Friday they had captured Daleh, said Saturday  they had seized the town of Al-Musaymir, further south and only 30 kilometres  (18 miles) from the southern air base at Al-Anad.
Independent sources said fighting was going on close to Al-Musaymir  Saturday with tank and artillery reinforcements deployed in the area to  bolster the north's forces.
Southern forces were trying to repel the advance by launching air raids on  northern positions, the sources in Aden said.
With the loss of Daleh, the south stepped up efforts to end the fighting  calling Saturday for the Arab League to intervene in the 10-day-old war  between rival northern and southern troops, Aden Radio said.
Late Friday northern leaders rejected a seven-point peace plan put forward  by the southern Yemen Socialist Party as "nothing new."
Aden radio said the Council for the Coordination between Parties and the  Masses, Organizations and Nationalists in Aden had sent a message to the  League urging it to protect "towns and citizens against all acts of  aggression."
The League should intervene to see that a reconciliation accord signed in  Amman in February between the two parties is implemented, added the radio,  monitored by the BBC.
An Arab League delegation has been in Yemen since Thursday trying to  broker a ceasefire between Saleh and his southern rival, ousted vice-president  Ali Salem al-Baid.
They hope to deliver a call from the League's secretary general, Esmat  Abdel Meguid, for an immediate ceasefire.
A northern spokesman in Sanaa said the meeting was finally likely to take  place on Saturday.
Earlier southern military officials said their warplanes were mounting raid  after raid on the Daleh region, where correspondents saw seven northern  soldiers dead on the side of the road, just five kilometres (three miles) from  the village.
Hundreds of residents have fled Daleh and surrounding villages, seeking  safety in Aden.
Clashes were also taking place in the Abyan region, east of Aden, but  fighting had eased in Kharaz, on the coast 120 kilometres (75 miles) to the  west of the city.
The ruler of Bahrain, Emir Issa ibn Salman al-Khalifa, Saturday joined the  ceasefire calls and urged Yemen's rival leaders "to allow reason to prevail."
The south's ceasefire plan on Friday called for the creation of a national  unity government, prisoners releases and for the right of political parties to  be recognised.
But Sanaa repeated demands for the surrender of southern leaders, accusing  them of seeking partition, four years after former North and South Yemen were  unified in May 1990.
In the latest evacuation of foreigners from the war-torn country, more  than 200 nationals of the former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow on a  flight out of Moscow, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said.
The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619 Filipinos, including 40  children and six pregnant women, were still waiting evacuation from Yemen.

Switzerland's Tony Rominger won his  sixth stage in the Tour of Spain here on Saturday, all but guaranteeing a  record-breaking hat-trick of wins in the event.
The 1992 and 1993 winner, who has led this year's race since the opening  time trial, triumphed again in a 53km solo ride against the clock.
Barring accidents, he should make history on Sunday in the final leg. No  rider has ever won the Vuelta three times in succession.

England's FA Cup final between Chelsea and  Manchester United here on Saturday remained goalless at half-time in a  typically super-charged, yet scrappy match.
Denmark's Jakob Kjeldbjerg nearly stole the limelight in this most  prestigious sporting fixture in the English calendar.
From a Denis Wise free-kick after 33-minutes, the ball came at an awkward  height for Chelsea's John Spencer on the edge of the box. He shot lamely, but  the ball came out nicely for Kjeldbjerg, who fired straight at Schmeichel.
The match began with a crowded midfield and slippery pitch stifling skill  and any flowing moves. Norwegian Erland Johnsen was booked in the first minute  for a foul on Giggs as the Londoners gave a first showing of their rugged  tactics.
Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce also went into the book in the 18th  minute as the double-chasers became more and more frustrated. Though United  began the match as overwhelming favourites, it was Chelsea who gained the  upper hand midway through the half.
Mark Stein had the first real chance in the 22nd minute at the near post.  And three minutes later, his Chelsea striker partner John Spencer just failed  to make contact in front of Schmeichel's goal.
Moments afterwards, Gavin Peacock confirmed the Londoners superiority as  he hit the crossbar with Schmeichel well beaten. It was Peacock who scored  both goals as Chelsea did a league double over champions United this season.
In the 37th minute, France's Eric Cantona headed across Chelsea's goal,  but Mark Hughes just failed to connect with a header as he sprinted forward.
The most positive player in the first half was Ukrainian winger Andrei  Kanchelskis, whose pace continually threatened Chelsea's defence.

White House officials dimissed  reports that President Bill Clinton and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds  were to discuss Northern Ireland here on Saturday.
Clinton had invited Reynolds, who is in the United States on a trade trip,  to join him but officials insisted there would be no talks.
Reynolds was here anyway to speak at a university so the president invited  him to join him as a courtesy, said a White House official.

Two Asian cargo ships, each carrying around 20  crew, collided Saturday in the English Channel and one of the vessels was on  the point of sinking off Dover, British coastguards said.
Three helicopters, including one from the French coastguard, and rescue  vessels were on the way to the scene of the collision, which occurred at 2:30  p.m. (1330 GMT).
Dover coastguards were unable to provide further details about the  collision.
Rescue boats from Newhaven, Hastings and Eastbourne were alerted after  coastguards received distress calls from one of the ships.
Lloyd's underwriters in London named vessels in collision as the Tokyo  registered Ariake, carrying a cargo of fruit, and the Taiwanese-registered  container ship Ming Fortune.
According to Lloyd's the Ming Fortune was the more seriously damaged of  the two.

Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic denounced  Saturday as "unacceptable" western calls for a four-month ceasefire throughout  Bosnia.
"We think that is too long. (A) two month (ceasefire) would suffice to  find a political solution," Izetbegovic told journalists here.
He added that Bosnian insistence on a "temporary ceasefire means we retain  the military option at our disposal if political negotiations fail."
The call for a four-month truce was issued Friday by foreign ministers of  the United States, Russia and several European countries.

Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warned world  leaders Saturday against accepting the current territorial division in Bosnia,  and linked settlement of that war with resolution of Zagreb's breakaway Serb  problem.
In a letter to his US counterpart Bill Clinton, Tudjman said that "any  freezing of the present situation and any delay in finding a solution will  only prolong the people's agony and threaten peace in a large part of Europe."
Breakaway Bosnian Serbs control around 70 percent of Bosnia but accounted  for 31 percent of the pre-war population.
A proposed Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia would be given 51 percent of  the territory under an internationally brokered peace plan, but its leaders  are still holding out for 58 percent of the land. Moslems made up 44 percent  of the prewar population and Croats 17 percent.
Tudjman said finding a solution to the two-year-old Bosnian war was  "inseparable" from ending the "Serb occupation" of a quarter of Croatian  territory in the Krajina region.
"A lasting settlement (of the conflicts in the ex-Yugoslavia) must be  found through a global approach" to the region's problems, he said.
Tudjman expressed his "gratitude" to Clinton for the "major role" played  by the United States in finding "lasting and just solutions" to the Bosnia  war, including the US-brokered Croat-Moslem federation.
He also thanked western nations and Russia for their efforts to "encourage  the Serb party to accept a fair political settlement, and impose if necessary   such a settlement on the forces blocking the peace process."

A joint Palestinian-Israeli  patrol stopped extremists from the banned racist Kach movement from praying in  Jericho's synagogue overnight, Israeli military sources said Saturday.
The Kach members tried to slip into the Shalom al Israel synagogue under  cover of darkness across fields around the building.
But the joint patrol, which included Palestinian police who only took up  their new duties on Friday, discovered the ploy and stopped the group outside  the synagogue.
The group then obeyed the patrol's orders to leave.
Kach was banned by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shortly after the  February 25 Hebron mosque massacre in which a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab  worshippers.
It was the second time that Israelis had tried to get into the synagogue  since the army withdrew from the West Bank town of Jericho on Friday  transferring powers to the Palestinians. Jewish settlers from Ofra, north of  the town, have also tried to enter.
Under the Israel-PLO self-rule deal signed on May 4 in Cairo, the  synagogue is to be administered by the Palestinians in coordination with the  Israeli ministry for religious affairs.

Pope John Paul II is now walking on crutches and  should be able to leave hospital at the end of next week after breaking his  right thigh on May 5, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday.
"At that time, he should be down to one crutch," the spokesman said.
No decision has yet been made on whether the pope will recuperate at the  Vatican or his nearby summer residence, Castel Gandolfo. The Castel Gondolfo  has a swimming pool, which could be useful for hydrotherapy, but has many  steps.

Saudi riot police took up positions around the  Iranian pilgrims camp at Mecca Saturday where a political rally is due to be  held despite a Saudi ban, the official agency IRNA said.
Three days ahead of Tuesday's planned anti-US and anti-Israel  demonstrations, police were deployed on both sides of the entrance to the  camp, while about 10 police cars and armoured vehicles were stationed in the  streets opposite, the agency said.
It also charged that two cameras, placed on the roofs of two tall  buildings across the street, were filming all movements to and from the camp  around the clock.
Saudi authorities warned last week that it would not allow Iranian  pilgrims to carry out their demonstrations.
The warning came after the head of the Iranian pilgrims delegation,  Mohammad Mohammad Rey-Shahri, said taking part in the demonstration was an  Islamic duty.
Similar demonstrations have triggered clashes with Saudi police in the  past, the most violent being in 1987, when 400 pilgrims, including 275  Iranians, were killed. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were broken  off for three years afterwards.
Tehran and Riyadh are also in dispute over the the numbers of Iranian  pilgrims allowed in Mecca this year. Iran says Saudia Arabia has halved its  quota of pilgrims to 60,000.
But Riyadh countered that it was applying a quota system agreed with other  Islamic countries allowing one pilgrim for every thousand people.
The annual Moslem pilgrimage is to start on May 19 in Mecca, the birth  place of the prophet Mohammad and Islam's holiest shrine.

Record-breaking Michael Schumacher overcame his  fears to push himself to the limit here on Saturday and grab pole position for  the Monaco Grand Prix.
But the race is still sure to be overshadowed by Thursday's crash  involving Karl Wendlinger.
The Austrian is in a deep coma, the latest nightmare faced by Formula One  after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino  Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Schumacher, who has won all three races this season, stamped his authority  on Saturday's final official practice in the Benetton-Ford, clocking a record  1min 18.560secs to beat Nigel Mansell's best of 1:19.495, set here two years  ago.
The German, averaging 152km/h, was nearly a second faster than Finland's  Mika Hakkinen, at the wheel of the McLaren-Peugeot.
Schumacher said: "I was totally confident in the car and I pushed myself  to the limit -- despite the recent events, I did not have any problems  concentrating.
"I haven't worked out my race strategy yet but I'm very confident."
Gerhard Berger, who has done much to mobilise drivers over safety in the  last fortnight, and will be a leading figure in the newly-formed Grand Prix  Drivers Association, set the third best time in a Ferrari.
Out of respect for Senna and Ratzenberger, the drivers were set to leave  the front row clear on Sunday, starting a line further back.
The late Senna's teammate at Williams-Renault, Damon Hill, will start on  the second row of cars alongside Berger, whose French teammate Jean Alesi will  start on the third with Brazil's Christian Fittipaldi in the Footwork Ford.
Hugely talented and driving the best car in the championship, Schumacher  now has no serious rival for the crown in the wake of Senna's death.
McLaren-Peugeot and Ferrari are also likely to win races this season, as  could Hill but there is little doubt that Benetton-Ford will get the top prize.

American John David Jackson was stripped of his WBA  middleweight world crown here on Saturday for fighting a bout without official  permission.
WBA committee president Elias Cordova said the title was now vacant and  would go to the winner of a fight between American Beggie Johnson and Jorge  Castro of Argentina.
He claimed Jackson, who won the title on October 1 last year, fought a  10-round bout on May 6 against compatriot Jess Johnson without clearance.

North Korea, threatening to reignite an  international row Saturday, said it had begun refuelling a controversial  nuclear reactor without international inspectors who want to test if material  has been diverted for atomic weapons.
"The replacement of fuel rods has begun at our five-megawatt experimental  nuclear power station according to its operational plan," a North Korean  foreign ministry spokesman told the official Korean Central News Agency  monitored in Tokyo.
Pyongyang's action at its Yongbyong complex risks heightening the nuclear  standoff with South Korea and the United States. US officials believe  Yongbyong holds the key to whether or not North Korea has developed its own  nuclear bomb.
International Atomic Engery Agency (IAEA) inspectors were due to leave  Vienna on Sunday to go to North Korea.
If they do not get satisfactory access, Washington may carry out its  threat to ask the United Nations to impose sanctions against North Korea.  South Korea meanwhile fears the growing dispute will erupt into conflict.
The North Korean spokesman said the IAEA had refused to send inspectors to  observe refuelling at the Yongbyong plant unless fuel rods could be sampled.
"Under such conditions, we had no choice but to remove the seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman was quoted as saying  by the news agency.
The IAEA's inspectors were due to arrive in North Korea Tuesday.
Agency spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna earlier Saturday that North  Korea had begun "preparations" for changing fuel rods at Yongbyong. He said  the inspectors would cut short the visit if the operation had reached a  "critical stage."
The North Korean official said, "refuelling is taking place under the  watch of the cameras installed by the agency. So, there are no grounds for  concern about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another purpose."
The North Korean official added however that there remained "possibilites"  to resolve the nuclear impasse.
"We proposed negotiations to the agency to make an agreement on practical  matters related to being present at the replacement of fuel and complicated  outstanding issues linked to it," he said.
The North Korean spokesman reaffirmed Pyongyang was prepared to "store all  the spent fuel under the strict surveillance of the IAEA and fully allow the  IAEA to measure it" when the dispute is settled between North Korea and the  United States.
IAEA inspectors went into Yongbyong, 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of  Pyongyang in March. That followed a one-year halt of inspections of North  Korea's seven declared nuclear sites.
But North Korea denied them access to a radio-chemical laboratory at the  plant, further raising suspicions that it was developing nuclear arms. Western  experts believe the laboratory may be a processing facility.
The hardline communist state later notified the IAEA of its plan to refuel  the reactor at the experimental power station.
It said IAEA inspectors could watch the replacement of fuel rods. But it  refused to let them sample the rods to see whether North Koreans had removed  seals on the fuel. Testing the rods would determine whether fuel had been  diverted for a military programme.
North Korea threatened last year to totally withdraw from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). That followed a US-led campaign to force the  North to allow full international inspection of it's nuclear facilities,  including two undeclared sites.
Pyongyang "suspended" its decision to leave the treaty last June, but  continued to deny full inspections of its nuclear sites saying the country was  in a "unique" status under a suspended membership.
Earlier this month, Robert Gallucci, the US assistant secretary of state  for politico-military affairs, said he was not confident a diplomatic solution  could be found to the problem.
Gallucci has been closely involved in talks with North Korea in which  Washington is thought to have offered economic aid and diplomatic recognition  in return for nuclear inspections.
Defense Secretary William Perry said last week that "a very dangerous  situation" would be develop unless the standoff was ended.

In a decision that could mark a turning  point in sexual abuse trials, a jury ruled therapists altered the memory of  their patient and falsely cultivated visions of her father raping her.
The Friday ruling challenges the strength in court of so-called recovered  memories and supports the right of third parties to sue therapists.
Recovered memories are the emergence in adulthood of childhood  recollections through psychological treatment. Supporters and opponents of the  theory kept a close eye on the case.
Winery executive Gary Ramona had sought eight million dollars from family  counselor Marche Isabella, psychiatrist Richard Rose and the Western Medical  Center in Anaheim, charging malpractice in treating his daughter, Holly, 23.
She reported flashbacks of childhood sexual abuse while being treated for  eating disorders and depression four years ago.
Gary Ramona accused Rose and Isabella of using "drugs and quackery" to  convince Holly that he raped and sexually molested her from age five until age  16.
Attorneys for Gary Ramona argued the flashbacks could have come from a  urinary tract examination Holly had at age six.
The jury awarded Gary Ramona 500,000 dollars. He had lost his  400,000-dollar-a-year job, and his wife divorced him, even though he was never  charged.
Experts split on the verdict's impact.
"It's going to intrude upon and jeopardize the ability of therapists to  provide good quality, competent therapy," said Mary Riemersma, executive  director of the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists.
"People have to realize that engaging in activities that lead people to  create wild memories is hurting all of society," said Elizabeth Loftus, a  University of Washington psychologist who testified for Ramona.

Result in the FA Cup final at Wembley stadium on  Saturday
Manchester United 4 (Cantona 61pen, 66pen, Hughes 68, McClair 92) Chelsea  0     mo94
---
Manchester United clinched the League and FA Cup  double here on Saturday to confirm their status as one of the greatest teams  in English history.
Two penalties from Frenchman Eric Cantona and another strike by Welshman  Mark Hughes set up a United 4-0 cup triumph against Chelsea at Wembley.
Ryan Giggs was instrumental in the first goal as he tapped the ball into  Denis Irwin's path before crashing to the ground from a tackle.
As Irwin moved forward, Newton upended the Irishman for an obvious  penalty. Cantona, England's players' player of the year, stepped forward and  fired past Chelsea keeper Dmitri Kharine in the 61st minute.
Just five minutes later, United went further ahead. Ukrainian Andrei  Kanchelskis, in one of his many speedy forays into Chelsea territory, appeared  to be challenged by Frank Sinclair shoulder to shoulder.
But referee David Elleray had no hesitation in pointing to the spot once  more, Cantona repeating a carbon-copy spot-kick into the bottom right-hand  corner.
The match became a nightmare for Sinclair in the 68th minute when his  defensive error allowed Hughes through to score yet another high-profile goal  for his club. Hughes had scored United's second goal in their 2-1 victory over  Barcelona in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup final.
The result was sealed by Brian McClair in the final minutes, tapping into  an open goal after Paul Ince had dribbed past the goalkeeper.
United manager Alex Ferguson became the first manager to win the league  and cup double north and south of the border. He won the Scottish league and  cup double with Aberdeen in 1984.
Ferguson dedicated the success to the late Sir Matt Busby, whose side were  tragically robbed of likely double glory in the late 50s, early 60s by the  Munich air disaster, which claimed six player's lives in 1958.
Though Manchester turned up the heat markedly in the second half, the  match had been a scrappy, haphazard affair before the break.
Denmark's Jakob Kjeldbjerg nearly stole the early limelight in this most  prestigious sporting fixture in the English calendar.
---
From a Denis Wise free-kick after 33-minutes, the ball fell at an awkward  height for Chelsea's John Spencer on the edge of the box. He shot lamely, but  the ball came out nicely for Kjeldbjerg, who fired straight at Schmeichel.
The crowded midfield and slippery pitch stifled flowing play during the  opening exchanges. Norwegian Erland Johnsen was booked in the first minute for  a foul on Giggs as the Londoners gave a first showing of their rugged tactics.
Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce also went into the book in the 18th  as the double-chasers became more and more frustrated. Though United began the  match as overwhelming favourites, it was Chelsea who gained the upper hand  midway through the half.
Mark Stein had a good chance in the 22nd minute at the near post. And  three minutes later, his Chelsea striker partner John Spencer just failed to  make contact in front of Schmeichel's goal.
Moments afterwards, Gavin Peacock confirmed the Londoners superiority as  he hit the crossbar with Schmeichel well beaten. It was Peacock who scored  both goals as Chelsea did a league double over champions United this season.
In the 37th minute, France's Eric Cantona headed across Chelsea's goal,  but Mark Hughes just failed to connect with a header as he sprinted forward.
Four minutes after the interval, Giggs gave Chelsea a taster of further  attacking moves to come with a blistering shot. From then on, it was virtually  all United.
Manchester became the fourth team this century to win the double after  Spurs in 1961, Arsenal in 1971, and Liverpool's 1986 team.
Chelsea were denied their first ever cup success at Wembley. Their 1970  winning team took the trophy in an Old Trafford replay against Leeds.
McLair replaced Kanchelskis with just five minutes to go and took full  advantage of his chance with a fitting finale.

A direct air service is to start between Burma and  Vietnam "at the earliest posible date," a statement issued said here Saturday,  at the end of a three-day visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet.
Agreements on the establishment of a joint commission for bilateral  cooperation and on trade and tourism were also signed during Kiet's official  visit, the joint statement said.
Both nations also reaffirmed their desire to boost economic cooperation,  as well as cooperation in the fields of culture, agriculture, forestry,  education and science, and in the fight against illicit drugs.

Comedienne and television star Roseanne Arnold  filed a second time for divorce from husband Tom Arnold, a rerun of last  month's filing.
Last time she accused her husband of beating her, but Friday she cited  irreconcilable differences. Last time Tom Arnold said the two would reconcile.  This time he had no comment.
Roseanne Arnold asked in her petition that she not be forced to pay  alimony and requested a judge to divide her multimillion-dollar assets.
She is one of the stars of the hit television comedy "Roseanne." Her  husband has a less successful comedy on another network called "Tom."

Moscow is to propose its own accord with NATO  extending beyond the Atlantic alliance's Partnership for Peace programme to  reflect Russia's status, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev indicated Saturday.
The NATO partnership programme, which offers former Warsaw Pact countries  closer military cooperation but stops short of giving them full alliance  membership, was "very abstract and provisional" and "not altogether  sufficient" for Russia's needs, said Kozyrev, cited by the Interfax news  agency.
Moscow's tailor-made accord with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  would centre on the conversion of arms production to civilian usage,  peacekeeping operations and military cooperation, Kozyrev told Russian  journalists in Geneva.
He said any partnership should include provision for joint military  manoeuvres and political consultations, as is currently the case over Bosnia.
Meanwhile Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said he would use a meeting with  his NATO counterparts in Brussels on May 24 outline Russia's requirements for  a partnership accord.
Early in 1993 Russia indicated it would join the NATO partnership.
But Moscow's membership of the partnership programme, which a clutch of  eastern European countries have already joined, recently ran into snags after  NATO carried out air strikes in Bosnia last month without consulting Moscow.

Boris Becker moved into only the fourth clay-court  final of a career dominated by grass and hardcourts Saturday as he ousted Ivan  Ivanisevic 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) at the Italian Open.
The triple Wimbledon winner gained a dose of confidence on clay in time  for the start of the French Open in just over a week with his one hour,  37-minute victory.
Becker will play American Pete Sampras in Sunday's final. Sampras beat  Czech Slava Dosedel, world-ranked 51, 6-1, 6-2, in the other semi-final.
The eighth-seeded German world number 13 took the opening set 6-2 from the  Croatian and grabbed a 4-1 lead in the second set before Ivansevic woke up.
"That is too much to give to a good player like Boris", said Ivanisevic,  last year's losing finalist to Jim Courier at the Foro Italico, but a two-time  loser this spring in first-round contests on clay.
Becker was broken for 3-4 by the 22-year-old Croatian and the second set  eventually went to a tiebreaker.
Becker, playing in Rome for the first time in six years, came back from  2-4  down and swept into the final on his first match point when he  anticipated an Ivansevic volley return at the net and put the ball out of the  frustrated Croatian's reach.
"I had a lot of easy mistakes", said Ivansevic, who hurt his knee this  week playing soccer in Rome and has been under treatment."I'm disappointed, I  don't know exactely what went wrong.
"I couldn't seem to put a ball in the court. But I still think that I am  playing good tennis no matter."

Ugandans living on the shores of Lake Victoria  have embarked on a major grave digging effort to bury thousands of corpses  that continue to flow into the lake from Rwanda though the River Kagera.
Health officials warned Saturday that unless the mass burials were  expedited, expidemics could break out, especialy in the western districts of  Masaka and Rakai, where mutilated, decomposing bodies continue to flood in  from the ethnic massacres in neighbouring Rwanda.
Ugandan villagers have buried an estimated 26,000 bodies recovered from  the lake during the past three weeks, said Emmanuel Pinto, a member of  parliament from western Uganda.
But many other bodies were buried before the government established a task  force to deal with the corpse problem, Pinto added.
The official New Vision newspaper reported on Friday that bodies were  arriving at the rate of 1,600 daily.
There are plans to start recovering the bodies from the river before they  flow into the lake.
The UN World Health Organisation has supplied villagers with grave digging  tools to speed up the macabre exercise.
Rwanda plunged into civil war pitting minority Tutsis in the Rwandan  Patriotic Front against the Hutu-dominated army and pro-government militias  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in suspicious plane crash  on April 6.
Children and women were clubbed or hacked to death with machetes as  militiamen giggled at their agony, according to witnesses.
The death toll has topped 200,000 in little more than a month of the  ethnic carnage. Some estimates have put the figure much higher.
An estimated half a million other Rwandans have fled to neighbouring  countries.

About 100 employees of fugitive real  estate promoter Juergen Schneider have turned themselves in to Germany's  income tax department in a bid to avoid penalties and court cases, Bild am  Sonntag reports in its edition due to appear Sunday.
Frankfurt prosecutor Hildegard Becker-Toussaint said the employees had  been turning themselves in all over the country since Schneider disappeared in  early April owing some five billion German marks (three billion dollars) to  dozens of creditor institutions.
The newspaper said employees of Schneider's firms had received undeclared  cheques and cash on top of their salaries.
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office has prepared prosecutions.

Steffi Graf will meet Brenda Schultz in the final  of the German Open on Sunday after both players enjoyed straight set victories  in glorious sunshine.
Top seed Graf, who has won the event in seven of the last eight years,  defeated third seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic 6-2 6-3, while Schultz  of Holland reached her second final of the year with a 7-6 (8/6) 6-3 upset  over seventh seed Anke Huber.
Germany's Graf looked far more positive than she had against Julie Halard  in the quarter-finals. She mixed up her game, confusing Novotna with a  selection of dropshots, lobs, driving forehands and sliced backhands.
Novotna, who received treatment for an ankle injury in the fourth game,  had plenty of good ideas of her own, but failed to execute them with the same  efficiency.
She often underhit the ball or was passed as she came in, and was also  forced into errors when Graf added pace to the ball.
Graf set the tone by breaking serve for 2-1, and Novotna netted a forehand  to go down 4-1. Graf then held three set points at 5-1, but Novotna escaped  first with a backhand pass and then two Graf errors.
Graf finally took the 1st set with a crosscourt forehand, but fell behind  0-2 in the 2nd set as Novotna staged a brief revival. But Graf broke back in  the next game and always looked comfortable from that point on.
Novotna gave full credit to Graf, but blamed a slippery court for most of  her problems.
"I played smartly, but it's very hard to do something when you're slipping  and sliding all over the place" she moaned.
"If I needed to come in I had no grip. It's not my shoes. I think I have  the best shoes I can have. Everyone has complained about the court all week  but they did nothing. If you have ideas and can't get there because of the  court it's very upsetting."

The nights may be clear and balmy on the  French Riviera, but the stars have singularly failed to come out on the  opening weekend of the 47th Cannes International Film Festival.
Clint Eastwood, who stole the show at the opening ceremony Thursday, has  withdrawn to his retreat in the mountains behind the town, while his  vice-president Catherine Deneuve has similarly headed for the hills.
The only minor celebrities in town, along with any director worth his  clapperboard, are holed up in various five-star hotels strictly on the  upmarket end of the Croisette seaside boulevard.
A far cry from the heady days of 1991 when US media-opportunity Madonna  had the newshounds racing for their mobile phones when she arrived unannounced  at the world's biggest filmfest.
Not that no stars are due in town before the festival reaches its climax  on Monday May 23.
The list of those due to make their way up the famous steps of the  Festival Palace over the next week inclwtes such household names as Bruce  Willis, John Travolta and Kathleen Turner.
A few French "vedettes" (stars) have also shown their faces on the  cocktail circuit -- notably Isabelle Adjani -- promoting her film "La Reine  Margot" (Queen Margot), the French frontrunner for the coveted Golden Palm  award.
There was also a report Saturday that Cannes regular Roman Polanski was  about to hit town with Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley, fresh from shooting  a new film in Paris.
But for the hopeful star-gazers lined up on the Cannes sea-front, for the  moment at least, not a twinkle.

The US, western Europe and Russia have finally  agreed on a joint approach to put Bosnian peace efforts back on track, but  failed Saturday to win anything other than criticism from the warring parties.
The peace-plan endorsed by the US and Russia and five west European states  in Geneva late Friday would provide 51 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina to a  Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to Serbs.
Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic said: "They (the leading powers) want us  to achieve a peace settlement and at the same they want us to swallow the  results of ethnic cleansing. Those two things are contradictory."
While the Geneva meeting participants previously epoused the principle of  rejecting territorial gains made by force, they had urged acceptance of the  51/49 percent plan, "which of course will not produce results," Ganic said.
Ganic said: "We are being squeezed by the international community."
"If you legitimize ethnic cleansing and genocide then of course it means  that you give a green light for similar cases to start somewhere else," Ganic  also warned.
Warning of the danger of "rewarding aggression," Bosnian Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic saw shortcomings in the Geneva call for a four-month ceasefire  and a fresh negotiations to begin within two weeks.
He said the approach adopted by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and the European foreign ministers contained no time schedule for  implementation of the peace plan, and no "guarantees" for the Bosnian Moslems.
"Force should be used to implement the peace agreement," Silajdzic also  said. He suggested a time-frame of one month. "If any party violates the  schedule measures should be taken," Silajdzic said.
Meanwhile the Belgrade-backed Serb forces, which control about 70 percent  of the former Yugoslav republic as a result of their war-gains in over two  years of conflict, said the Moslems and Croats could not have even 51 percent.
Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament,  said the Moslems and Croats could not have more territory than the Serbs "as  they are neither the moral nor military victors" and did not own that much.
"We believe that one has to take into account the situation on the ground,  namely that the Serbs control 73 per cent of the territory and that they are  owners of 64 percent," the Bosnian Serb news agency quoted him as saying.
Ganic said that the 51 percent for Croats and Moslems did not provide  enough place for the people concerned.
But he found "interesting" the Geneva meeting's call for a cessation of  hostilities and withdrawal of heavy artillery. "I think that this is something  we will look carefully at and that we will negotiate with the Serbs," he said.
In Sarajevo, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he considered a  four-month ceasefire unacceptably long and that two months should suffice to  reach a solution to the conflict.
As an incentive to the Serbs to make peace, Friday night's final  declaration held out the prospect of a phased suspension of international  sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in return for  compliance in good faith with a peace agreement.
Saturday also saw Christopher toast a US-brokered agreement for a  federation of Moslem Bosnians and Croats with a glass of champagne and hopeful  words, but there was no formal signing ceremony, contrary to previous  expectations.
A framework had been established for protecting the political and human  rights of the people who lived in the federation, Christopher said. "The  darkness of inter-ethnic strife is slowing giving way to a glimmer of  reconciliation."
The message of the ceremony was that peace could be achieved through  negotiations, he said.
Despite all efforts, the international community has so far been unable to  resolve the main conflict which erupted in Bosnia-Hercegovina when the Serbs  refused to accept its independence amid the break-up of Yugoslavia.

Helicopters winched the 21 crew  members of a sinking Taiwanese container vessel to a nearby ship in the  channel Saturday after a collision in thick fog, the French maritime emergency  centre here reported.
The second vessel involved in the collision, the refrigerated vessel  Ariake, was taken under tow by the merchant vessel Aberthauw toward Britain.
The collision between the Ming Fortune, of Taiwan, and the Ariake, which  was variously described as Japanese- and Panamanian-registered, came at 3:30  p.m. (1330 GMT).
Rescue workers at this French channel port said the crew of the Ming  Fortune were put aboard the Maltese-registered Steersman by one French and two  British helicopters, adding that the Taiwanese boat was sinking.
British rescue boats from Newhaven, Hastings and Eastbourne were alerted  after coastguards received distress calls from one of the ships.
It was the fifth such accident in the Channel or North Sea in five years.

Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds  briefed President Bill Clinton here Saturday on Northern Ireland during a  private meeting said a White House official.
Earlier officials had insisted the two leaders would not get together but  later admitted they had talked for about 15 minutes.
Reynolds, who arrived in the United States on Friday, had not been  scheduled to meet any members of the US administration during his trip, which  is essentially concerned with trade, until he received the last-minute  invitation from Clinton.
On Friday the Irish government transmitted a document to London detailing  demands for clarification of the Anglo-Irish joint declaration from Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
Clinton told Reynolds that he hoped the latest developments would lead to  a solution.
"The president commended him for his good works and expressed the hope  that this will work to some resolution," said spokesman Mark Gearan.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams on Friday urged the British government to  respond positively to the clarification request, saying: "It is necessary that  the replies from London to our questions properly and honestly clarify these  issues so that the peace process can be advanced."
A statement issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said the  British government would study and make public Sinn Fein's demands for  clarification.
Reynolds is due to fly back to Dublin on Sunday.

Boris Becker and Pete Sampras face an Italian Open  final showdown after surprising their critics with clay-court successes here  on Saturday.
The duo, who have claimed just one title on the surface between them, both  eased through their semi-finals in straight sets.
But the German triple Wimbledon champion was forced to work harder,  winning a second-set tie-break before seeing off Ivan Ivanisevic 6-2, 7-6  (7/5).
Sampras, whose only success on the surface came in Kitzbuehel in Austria  in 1992, crushed Czech outsider Slava Dosedel in just over an hour.
He beat Jim Courier's conqueror 6-1, 6-2. Sampras currently boastssix  titles from eight events on the ATP tour this year.
Both players will see the final as ideal preparation for the French Open  in just over a week.
The American world number one said: "This final is a big match for both of  us. I know that we'll both be ready to play."
Becker, however, was less upbeat about his chances. "I'm going in  expecting the worst but hoping for the best," he said. "The five-set format  will be better for me, it could allow me to work my way into the match, but  Pete is obviously the one to beat."

Britain's opposition Labour Party, united in grief  over the sudden death of leader John Smith, is however expected to waste no  time naming a successor tipped to win the next election, analysts said  Saturday.
Officially, the party has thus far refused to speculate on the likely  outcome of a leadership contest, with party chairman David Blunkett calling  Saturday on the press to allow the movement a few days' grace to mourn Smith,  who died of a heart attack Thursday.
"I would ask people to give us a few days to because many of us are still  reeling," he said.
But he added that the leadership issue would be resolved "sensibly but  quickly," with mid-July a likely deadline.
Lauded by a succession of parliamentary colleagues as "the best prime  minister Britain never had," Smith had been destined to lead his party into  power after the next elections due by 1997, analysts said.
Enjoying a substantial lead in the polls over the long-governing  Conservatives at the time of his death, Smith had managed through  modernisation to unite Labour's left and right wings, and reassured the  electorate by eroding the union's hold over the party's decision-making  process.
Many within the party believe his successor will be ideally placed to  guide that process to fruition at the ballot box.
"At the end of the day what matters is not if you agree with somebody but  if you can trust him," said left-wing Labour grandee Tony Benn, in an  assessment at once paying homage to Smith and outlining the qualities the  party next leader will need to bring to the job.
Lord Callaghan, Labour's last prime minister in the 1970s, also urged a  swift leadership contest.
"I would certainly like to see it got on with," he said." There is ...  less than a couple of years before" the next general election.
The party itself may steer clear of speculation, but the press and London  bookmakers have already designated their man: shadow home secretary Tony Blair.
Belonging like Smith to the party's right wing, Blair, a fresh-faced  41-year-old with a reputation as a charismatic speaker, is currently the  bookies' 1-3 favourite for the top job.
An MP for the last 11 years and a member of the shadow cabinet since 1984,  Blair was hailed Saturday in a Financial Times profile as "the man who might  become Labour's JFK (John Fitzgerald Kennedy)."
His youth may count against him but the fact that he has never held a  government post will not, as that shortcoming is shared by all his senior  colleagues in a party which has not tasted power for 15 years.
Some commentators have cited a possible "dream ticket" partnership at the  head of the party between Blair and ebullient left-winger John Prescott.
Others, meanwhile, have tipped shadow chancellor Gordon Brown, 43, to head  the party, with acting leader Margaret Beckett, 51, fulfilling the deputy's  role she held under Smith.
According to an opinion poll Saturday the Conservative Party has now  fallen into third place -- 21 points behind Labour and half a point behind the  Liberal Democrats.
It gave Labour 45.5 percent, the Liberal Democrats 25 and the Tories just  24.5.
All three parties announced a suspension of campaigning for next month's  European elections until after Smith's funeral Friday in Edinburgh.
But whoever is chosen to head Labour will have to renew battle with a  combative John Major.
On Friday he warned would-be Conservative challengers to his rocky  premiership that he intended to serve as prime minister to the end of his  five-year mandate, which expires in 1997, and that critics should reserve  their judgement until then.
And although clearly shocked by his opponent's untimely death, Major's  confidence will have been boosted by the likely effect of Smith's demise on  the Tory leadership pretensions of Michael Heseltine, 61, who himself suffered  a heart attack last year, analysts said.

Southern leaders appealed to the Arab world Saturday  for help in ending Yemen's 10-day-old civil war after troops loyal to Yemeni  President Ali Abdallah Saleh seized the strategic town of Daleh.
Thousands of people mainly women, children and the elderly, demonstrated  in Aden, calling for an immediate end to the fighting, an AFP correspondent  reported.
Many brandished photos of ousted vice president Ali Salem al-Baid, a  southerner, and shouted anti-Saleh slogans.
Local and foreign journalists taken to Daleh, which lies 90 kilometres (55  miles) from the southern stronghold of Aden, confirmed it was held by northern  troops.
The frontline was reported to have shifted slighty south of the town as  northern troops continued their push towards Aden amid heavy fighting.
Meanwhile a group of southern organisations in Aden called on the Arab  League to "intervene directly and quickly to end the fighting."
It urged the League to protect "towns and citizens against all acts of  aggression."
But in Cairo League General Secretary Esmat Abdel Meguid ruled out any  early Arab summit to discuss the crisis. Last week a League emergency meeting  turned down an Egyptian proposal to send an Arab peacekeeping force to Yemen.
An Arab League delegation has been in Yemen since Thursday trying to  broker a ceasefire between Saleh and Baid.
It was also to deliver to Saleh a call from Meguid for an immediate  ceasefire. It was hoped the meeting would be held later Saturday.
Journalists in Aden said fighting was now raging five kilometres (three  miles) south of Daleh, scene of heavy bombing raids as southern airplanes  tried to repel a northern advance.
Earlier southern military officials said their warplanes were carrying out  raid after raid on the Daleh region, where correspondents saw seven northern  soldiers dead on the roadside just outside the town.
Northern officials maintained Saturday they had seized the town of  Al-Musaymir, south of Daleh and only 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the  southern air base at Al-Anad.
Journalists said tank and artillery reinforcements had been deployed in the  Al-Musaymir area to bolster the north's forces. Hundreds of civilians have  meanwhile have fled the fighting for the safety of Aden.
Southern leaders also called on the Arab League to intervene to ensure the  implementation of a reconciliation accord signed between the two sides in  February in Amman.
More than 20 people were killed in clashes which broke out immediately  after the accord was signed in the Jordanian capital.
But a seven-point peace plan put forward late Friday by the southern Yemen  Socialist Party called on the country's leaders not to give up on the  agreement.
The ceasefire plan which called for an immediate end to fighting was  dismissed as "nothing new" by northern leaders, who in turn repeated demands  for the surrender of the "war criminal" Baid.
Meanwhile a military spokesman in Aden said southern troops were fighting  their northern rivals in the streets of Zinjibar, 60 kilometres (36 miles)  east of Aden to "wipe out pockets of resistance."
He added that the south continued to control the situation at Bab  al-Mandab 130 kilometres (80 miles) west of Aden, on the mouth of the Red Sea.
The south's ceasefire plan on Friday also called for the creation of a  national unity government, prisoners releases and for the right of political  parties to be recognised.
In the latest evacuation of foreigners from the war-torn country, more  than 200 nationals of the former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow on a  flight out of Moscow, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said.
The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619 Filipinos, including 40  children and six pregnant women, were still waiting evacuation from Yemen.

Twelve people were massacred by gunmen armed  with AK47 assault rifles in Tokoza black township east of here late Friday,  police said Saturday.
Police spokeswoman Janine Smith told the domestic news agency SAPA that  the gunmen stormed a house in the township and opened fire on the occupants at  7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT). The victims were aged between 13 and 25 years-old.
Smith said it appeared as if the youths had been staying in the house for  about a month and it was not known if they had been affiliated to any  political grouping.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Assef Ahmed Ali said  Saturday the United States no longer insisted that Islamabad roll back its  nuclear programme in isolation of India.
"The US is no longer attempting to roll back Pakistan's nuclear programme  on a unilateral basis," the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted  him saying at a seminar on the country's foreign policy here.
Ali was speaking during ongoing talks between US and Pakistani officials  over the nuclear impasse between Islamabad, New Delhi and Washington.
Pakistan and the United States had agreed to work for "progressive steps"  toward non-proliferation in South Asia, he said.
Pakistan was continuing its dialogue with the United States "within this  framework" to devise specific steps the success of which "will depend on a  more positive response from India," he said.
During the visit of US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott here in  April, Pakistan refused to agree to a proposed "verifiable cap on the  production of fissile materials."
The proposal was laced with the offer of "enhanced US cooperation with  Pakistan in various fields," but Islamabad said it would not give up its  nuclear option without India taking similar steps.
A joint statement at the end of Talbott's visit said the two sides had  agreed to pursue the goal of "capping, then reducing and finally eliminating  weapons of mass destruction and ballistic misslies in South Asia."
Ali said "a new cooperative engagement between Pakistan and the United  States was agreed during the visit of Talbott."
The United States cut off economic and military aid to Pakistan in 1990  because of concerns that Islamabad's nuclear programme was weapons oriented.  Later, it stopped delivery of a batch of F-16 fighter aircraft, due under a  1989 deal.
Pakistan's President Farooq Ahmed Leghari is expected to meet with  American officials during a private visit to the United States from May 19 to  June two and reports here said the nuclear issue feature in the talks.

Benetton manager Flavio Briatore, who swooped to  take control of French strugglers Ligier on Friday, said he would take his  time before announcing plans for his second Formula One team.
Briatore said on Saturday he would take a few days before making any  announcements, adding: "My wish is to make Ligier very competitive as quickly  as possible.
"I won't be changing anything yet because I know nothing about the team --  I won't be studying the matter until Monday, after the Monaco Grand Prix."
Briatore said it was "very interesting" to be in charge of two teams  backed by different engines.

Vice President Joshua Nkomo warned white  Zimbabweans Saturday they would ignite a race war unless they learned the  meaning of racial harmony and national unity.
In his first speech after attending the inauguration of South African  President Nelson Mandela, an impassioned Nkomo said that while it was clear  that all races there regarded the country as their own, Zimbabwean whites had  not embraced the policy of national reconciliation preached by the government  at independence in 1980.
"This is not what our heroes died for (in the war for independence),"  Nkomo told community leaders and farmers in the small south-western town of  Gwanda.
"Soon they shall be turning in their graves and a civil war will start,"  said the ageing former guerrilla leader. "Mark my words."
Nkomo said he had been impressed by the number of whites who had  participated in the celebrations to mark majority rule in South Africa and the  way white children had marched and danced with blacks.
This did not happen in Zimbabwe, where whites created separate  organisations, clubs and schools for themselves, he said.
"White parents, where are your children? Do you want us to fetch them out  so that they can participate in national functions?
"They are our children too. There is absolutely nobody who has a right to  hide them," the local ZIANA news agency reported Nkomo as saying.
He said that while the white community dominated the economy and blacks  suffered there would be a civil war, and called for all races to work together.
"We do not have to kiss each other, it is not necessary. But we have to  work together as a people if we are to succeeed in anything," he said.
Domination of Zimbabwe's economy by whites, who make up just one percent  of the country's 10 million people, has become an increasingly volatile  political issue, frequently referred to by both Nkomo and President Robert  Mugabe.
The government faces a general election within a year, with most black  Zimbabweans suffering economic hardships under a World Bank-backed Economic  Structural Adjustment Programme.

Malawians Saturday wound up an historic election  campaign bringing multiparty politics to a country ruled for the past three  decades by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
The ailing president inspected troops from an open truck as some 20,000  people turned up at a stadium here to celebrate his official birthday ahead of  elections May 17, while around 50,000 attended an opposition rally.
Banda, who is officially 88 but is widely believed to be in his 90s,  underwent brain-surgery last October and recently cut short an election  campaign tour of the country because of an undisclosed leg ailment.
Reading a prepared speech with some difficulty, Banda appealed to  Malawians to conduct themselves "as ladies and gentlemen" during the  elections, which should be "free and fair."
He said the Malawi army was "committed to serve the government of the day."
Meanwhile, the bigger opposition rally was addressed by the presidential  challenger favoured to win the elections, Bakili Muluzi of the United  Democratic Front (UDF).
He predicted that his party, with a strong base in the densely-populated  south of the country, would win the elections.
The UDF is the only opposition party that has fielded candidates for the  presidency and all 177 parliamentary seats.
Muluzi said Banda's government had done "nothing" to develop Malawi, while  his party would strive to fulfill its election promises, including free  education.
"There is a lot of poverty in this country. We want to change that and  make Malawi a prosperous nation," he said.
Earlier, Banda said in an address on national radio that his work of  ruling Malawi was not yet finished.
He said he and his ruling Malawi Congress Party had the experience and  skills necessary to face the "challenges and dangers" ahead of the country.
Banda, accused of serious human rights abuses during his rule, said his  government would respect human rights and uphold good and accountable  government.

Southeast Asia's economically booming nations  will consider a common approach to fight efforts by the West to link trade and  workers' rights, a senior Malaysian official said Saturday.
ASEAN labour ministers will discuss "the adoption of a common approach to  thwart international pressure to comply with rigid labour standards," at a  two-day meeting beginning Monday in Singapore, Human Resources Minister Lim Ah  Lek said here.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations comprises Brunei, Indonesia,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
"Malaysia would emphasise the need for developing countries to oppose the  rigid manner in which labour standards were likely to be imposed on them on  the basis of equality," Lim said in a statement to the Bernama news agency.
At a GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh, Morocco last month,  developing countries voiced fears that a bid to include labour rights in the  new World Trade Organisation (WTO) could be used by industrial nations as a  pretext for new forms of protectionism.
This was in response to pressure, mainly from the United States and  France, for the linking of trade and workers' rights be put on the WTO agenda.
The WTO will replace the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), which has operated on an interim basis since 1947, and will have  greater enforcement power in international trading relations.

Gypsies from communities spanning the  European Union, Romania and the former Yugoslavia are to attend the  continent's first congress in this southern Spanish city next week, officials  said Saturday.
The congress, to be opened by Queen Sofia and closed by Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez, aims to draw up a European Union policy on improving  integration of migrant gypsies and ending illiteracy.

Miners returned to work at the Western Areas  gold mine outside Johannesburg Saturday, where seven miners died in clashes  between rival political groups in the past month, owners Johannesburg  Consolidated Industries (JCI) said.
JCI said in a statement that more than 70 percent of staff had returned to  work but others were continuing to demand justice following the deaths of four  employees this week.
Earlier, JCI chief Kennedy Maxwell, quoted in the daily Citizen, said  management-led talks produced an agreement on a code of conduct, the setting  up of a committee of inquiry into the incidents and security arrangements  acceptable to all.
Seven people died in three and a half weeks of political tension between  supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African  National Congress (ANC) at the gold mine west of Johannesburg.
Mine engineer John Brownringgs told the newspaper that work would start up  Saturday. No independent confirmation was immediately available.
Security forces under the new government moved swiftly Thursday to prevent  further clashes at Western Areas and confiscated up to eight tonnes of  homemade and traditional weapons from the mine hostel, Frans van Rensburg, a  spokesman for JCI said earlier this week.
Trade union officials said politically motivated fighting between IFP and  ANC supporters started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first  all-race elections.
They said one person was killed on April 17, two others died in fighting  during the April 26-29 poll and four were killed Wednesday.
Nelson Mandela's ANC won the election, ending more than 300 years of  white-minority rule.
Because most miners stay in large hostels accommodating thousands of  people, ethnic and political differences often boil over and result in  violence.
In one of the worst incidents, four miners were killed Wednesday in an  underground battle in the mine's south shaft between workers armed with axes  and picks before security forces moved in to help restore order.
About 9,500 miners were on strike Friday after defying a court order  Thursday that ordered them back to work at the Kloof gold mine near  Carletonville, 50 kilometres (32 miles) west of here.
The owners of the Kloof mine, Gold Fields, estimated production loss since  the strike began on May 5 at around 25 million rands (6.8 million dollars) and  Friday ordered the strikers to return to work by Sunday.
Workers had downed tools eight days ago following the dismissal of a trade  union leader for allegedly intimidating workers during a strike in March.

Christopher said later that a formal signing ceremony in Geneva had been  dispensed with as superfluous, as a document setting out the proposed  federation had already been signed by Bosnian Croat leaders and the Bosnian  government in Vienna in March.

Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi Saturday urged his supporters to work for reconciliation  and peace in South Africa's violence-wracked black areas.
"Go out and break down the barriers that divide you from your political  opponenents," he said in a speech at a rally in KwaZulu-Natal where his party  trounced the African National Congress (ANC) in the April 26-29 election.
"Go out and spread the word of peace and reconciliation," he said. "There  can be no economic development in the region until we achieve peace. No  businessman will want to invest in this region if his life is in danger. No  investor will want to build factories if their factories are going to be  burned down."
Nelson Mandela's ANC swept to victory in the national poll, but lost in  Buthelezi's KwaZulu-Natal powerbase. The IFP came third nationally, after the  former ruling National Party and together the three parties make up the  government of national unity that was announced on Wednesday.
In a peace-broking move, Mandela gave Buthelezi the powerful Home Affairs  Ministry in his 27-member cabinet.
The two parties have engaged in bloody conflict in KwaZulu-Natal, where  10,000 people have been killed since 1990.
In his first speech as Home Affairs Minister, Buthelezi said Saturday: "We  will have to to work at political reconciliation if we are to end up with a  national will to make democracy work for the benefit of the people."

After collecting the Cup Bruce said: "This is a fantastic achievement by  the club. The players deserve credit and what can you say about our gaffer  Alex Ferguson? He has done everything. But I don't think we deserved to win  4-0. We didn't play that well."
Ferguson's thoughts in triumph immediately turned to Old Trafford  patriarch Sir Matt Busby, who died earlier this year. He said: "Sir Matt would  have been very proud of the players if he could have been here today.
"In the first half Chelsea caused us a lot of problems but at half-time we  spoke of the need to get Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis operating from wide  positions and after the break we spread the game out."
Ferguson, asked if he was disappointed to miss out on an unprecedented  treble because of United's League Cup Final defeat, replied: "Disappointed? I  will be happy with the double every year."
United romped to victory after Chelsea had hit their crossbar, Eric  Cantona tucking away two penalties.
Chelsea player-boss Glenn Hoddle said: "It all turned on our shot against  the crossbar and then the penalties. We have seen all season that once  Manchester United go in front, they are virtually unstoppable.
"We are dejected. We don't like losing but I was pleased with the way we  played. Once United were ahead, we were always chasing the game and leaving  gaps at the back. United had too much skill to let us get away with that."

North Korea, threatening to reignite an  international row Saturday, said it had begun refuelling a controversial  nuclear reactor without international inspectors who want to test if material  has been diverted for atomic weapons.
"The replacement of fuel rods has begun at our five-megawatt experimental  nuclear power station according to its operational plan," a North Korean  foreign ministry spokesman told the official Korean Central News Agency,  monitored in Tokyo.
Pyongyang's action at its Yongbyong complex risks heightening the nuclear  standoff with South Korea and the United States. US officials believe  Yongbyong holds the key to whether North Korea has developed its own nuclear  bomb.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were due to leave  Vienna on Sunday for North Korea, and in Vienna agency spokesman David Kyd  said Saturday the trip was still scheduled despite the North Korean statement,  as the IAEA had received no official advice of the refuelling.
He said that if refuelling had indeed started, it would be a "grave  violation" of agreements between the agency and North Korea on inspections.
"If the reports (of the refuelling) turn out to be correct, the inspectors  will be immediately recalled to Vienna," he said. Earlier Kyd had said that  the inspectors would cut short the visit if the refuelling operation had  reached a "critical stage" before their expected arrival Tuesday.
The North Korean spokesman said the IAEA had refused to send inspectors to  observe refuelling at the Yongbyong plant unless fuel rods could be sampled.
"Under such conditions, we had no choice but to remove the seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman was quoted as saying  by the news agency.
The North Korean official said, "refuelling is taking place under the  watch of the cameras installed by the agency. So, there are no grounds for  concern about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another purpose."
The North Korean official added however Pyongyang had proposed  negotiations with the IAEA to over its presence at the refueling and related  oustanding issues.
He reaffirmed Pyongyang was prepared to "store all the spent fuel under the  strict surveillance of the IAEA and fully allow the IAEA to measure it" when  the dispute is settled between North Korea and the United States.
IAEA inspectors went into Yongbyong, 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of  Pyongyang in March following a one-year halt of inspections of North Korea's  seven declared nuclear sites.
But North Korea denied them access to a radio-chemical laboratory at the  plant, further raising suspicions that it was developing nuclear arms. Western  experts believe the laboratory may be a processing facility.
The hardline communist state later said IAEA inspectors could watch the  replacement of fuel rods at the experimental plant. But it refused to let them  sample the rods to test whether fuel had been diverted for a military  programme.
North Korea threatened last year to totally withdraw from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty. That followed a US-led campaign to force the North  to allow full international inspection of it's nuclear facilities, including  two undeclared sites.
The US fears North Korea has enough fissile material to make four to five  nuclear weapons.
Pyongyang "suspended" its decision to leave the treaty last June, but  continued to deny full inspections of its nuclear sites saying the country was  in a "unique" status under a suspended membership.
Earlier this month, Robert Gallucci, the US assistant secretary of state  for politico-military affairs, said he was not confident a diplomatic solution  could be found to the problem.
Gallucci has been closely involved in talks with North Korea in which  Washington is thought to have offered economic aid and diplomatic recognition  in return for nuclear inspections.
If IAEA inspectors do not get satisfactory access, Washington may carry  out its threat to ask the United Nations to impose sanctions against North  Korea. South Korea meanwhile fears the growing dispute will erupt into  conflict.

Favourites Werder Bremen lifted the German Cup  here on Saturday by beating second division side Rot-Weiss 3-1.
Last year's Bundesliga champions, who finished a disappointing eighth this  season, salvaged their campaign after forging 2-0 clear by the break through  Dietmar Beiersdorfer (17th minute) and Austrian Andreas Herzog (38th).
Kiwi Wynton Rufer sealed the win with a penalty after Rott-Weiss had  pulled a goal back after 50 minutes.
Bremen, the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup holders, have reached the  German final four times in five years and won the trophy in 1991, 30 years  after their only other triumph.

Haitian strongman Lt. General Raoul Cedras,  head of the ruling military junta, warned that any US invasion of Haiti would  be met with fierce resistance by all the people of the nation.
Cedras said that the whole country would rise up if President Clinton  ordered US troops to invade.
An invasion "will be the most terrible mistake of the United States of  America" said Cedras during a taped interview with CNN's "Evans and Novak",  broadcast Saturday.
Earlier this week US forces carried out a mock air, land and sea invasion  involving 44,000 soldiers this week which the Boston Globe claimed was  developed with Haiti in mind.
White House and Pentagon officials denied it was a rehearsal for military  intervention in Haiti.
The Globe said the exercise used North Carolina and Puerto Rico as landing  sites for the mock invasion involving amphibious landing vessels, a submarine  and more than 200 sorties by Marine jet fighers.
A spokesman for the US Atlantic Command said the exercises had as a target  a fictitious country run by an "unfriendly leader" who had suddenly seized  power.
Last week President Bill Clinton refused to rule out a military  intervention to restore democracy in Haiti.
Cedras also warned that international action to toughen sanctions  threatens to tear his nation apart.
"They may provoke an explosion in this society," he warned.
Earlier this month the UN Security Council gave the Haitian military  leaders until May 21 to step down or face a full commercial embargo.
Cedras spoke with CNN Tuesday, the day before military-backed interim  president Emile Jonassaint took office. The installation was seen as an act of  defiance by Haiti against the international pressure.
---
Jonassaint's swearing-in by a Senate faction not recognized by the  international community was immediately condemned by the UN Security Council  and foreign governments as illegitimate.
The United States, France and other countries involved in the effort to  restore democracy in Haiti declared that deposed president Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, ousted by the military in 1991, was the country's only legitimate  and democratically elected president.
Cedras said the military were willing to negotiate and he hoped Clinton's  new envoy to Haiti, William Gray, would approach the conflict with an open  mind.
"I want to believe that he would come in a spirit of justice, in an open  spirit, to understand the Haitian problem and to understand that truth is not  really what is being said," said Cedras.
He also criticized reports that animals were eating human corpses left in  the streets and that the armed forces are responsible for human rights abuses.
"I would like to know the motivation, the reason," for these reports, said  Cedras, adding that the reports were blown out of proportion.
"They take these facts and these crimes and give them a political matter,"  insisted Cedras.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said  Saturday on the eve of a visit to Damascus there was still a long way to go to  forge a peace deal between arch enemies Israel and Syria.
Christopher, in Switzerland for talks on the former Yugoslavia, leaves for  Damascus Sunday, on a shuttle between Syria and Israel set to end on May 19.
He will be in Jerusalem Monday to "help parties move closer together," he  said, adding he could not rule out another visit to the Syrian capital.
"It's a long process," he said. "I do think the parties are serious and I  want to play my part and take the messages back and forth."
But he added, during a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa:  "I don't have any great ambitions for this particular trip."
On his last visit to the region in April Christopher conveyed Israeli  proposals for a phased withdrawal from the disputed Golan Heights to Syrian  President Hafez al-Assad.
The strategic heights occupied by Israel in 1967 and annexed in 1981 have  remained the main stumbling block to resuming direct peace talks between  Israel and Syria.
Commenting on the Golan Heights issue, Mussa said: "The parties are ready  to move forward. We are ready to help whenever our help is needed or required  but we don't impose ourselves."
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said Friday in an interview  with the US television news network CNN he thought Israel and Syria could make  peace within the coming months.
But Syria has remained sceptical about Christopher's forthcoming visit.  One official charged that Israel had reduced the US role to "a mere postman  delivering the Israeli point of view without any amendment."
US officials have also played down Christopher's shuttle mission.
"The one certainty is that there will be a lot of trips ... It will be a  long and arduous process," an official warned.

Added Bruce: "To be associated with names like Danny Blanchflower, Frank  McLintock and Alan Hansen who led their teams to the double is quite  incredible.
"I keep having to pinch myself to believe it. Never in my wildest dreams  did I imagine something like this would happen to me.
"If someone had told me ten years ago that I would lead a side to the  double, I would have thought they were joking."
Bruce cut into his celebrations to sympathise with Chelsea. "We were a bit  flattered by the scoreline," he admitted. "But once we got our noses in front,  they had to come at us. We have the skill up front to expose situations like  that."
Midfielder Paul Ince said: "We didn't play all that well and still won  4-0. Chelsea packed men behind the ball and you have to give them a bit of  credit. They hit the bar early on and if that shot had gone in, it might have  been a different story."
Chelsea striker Gavin Peacock twice hit winning goals in Premiership games  against United this season and saw his chance of a "hat-trick" disappear when  his 25th-minute lob rebounded from the United crossbar.
Said Peacock: "For the first 50 minutes we played very well. If my shot  had gone in instead of hitting the bar, I believe we would have won the game.  We were riding out the pressure through the second half until the penalty.  After that it was all very disappointing.
"But United have deservedly been acclaimed as the best team in the country  and you have to give them credit.
"Yet we held our own against them for a long time. A four-goal margin  flattered them but when we fell two goals behind, we had to chase it. But at  least we have the consolation of a place in Europe next season. We have a  young team and great support and I believe Chelsea will win something soon."
Danish international goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel missed United's Coca-Cola  Cup Final defeat through suspension and was doubtful until shaking off a  ligament injury.
He said: "I used to watch the FA Cup Final on television back home in  Denmark every year. To be part of it in a team that has won the English double  is unbelievable and incredible."

Southern leaders appealed to the Arab world  Saturday for help in ending Yemen's 10-day-old civil war after troops loyal to  Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh seized the strategic town of Daleh.
Thousands of people mainly women, children and the elderly, demonstrated  in Aden, calling for an immediate end to the fighting, an AFP correspondent  reported.
Many brandished photos of ousted vice president Ali Salem al-Baid, a  southerner, and shouted anti-Saleh slogans.
Local and foreign journalists taken to Daleh, which lies 90 kilometres (55  miles) from the southern stronghold of Aden, confirmed it was held by northern  troops.
Southern forces defending the strategic mountainous heights around Daleh  had been pushed back about 10 kilometres (six miles) by attacking northern  forces Saturday, an AFP correspondent said.
Daleh, close to the old border between former North and South Yemen on the  main road between Sanaa and Aden, fell on Thursday, soldiers said.
Some 300 southern troops have now taken up positions at Markula, about  1,000 metres (3,300 feet) in the mountains, about 80 kilometres (50 miles)  north of Aden.
At dawn on Saturday two surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 70  kilometres (43 miles) fell just 12 kilometres (seven miles) from the base at  Anad but fell into the desert, the local commander told AFP.
The officer, who declined to be named, said it was the first time in five  days that missiles had been fired at the base, which is hidden from the road  behind sand banks and heavily defended by anti-aircraft guns.
Six southern tanks were deployed in the streets and outskirts of Markula  along with as several multiple rocket launchers. Soldiers rested in the trees,  while others chewed qat, a green leaf which is a mild intoxicant.
Several hundred metres away on the roadside towards Daleh lay the bodies  of seven northern soldiers in military uniform, who had been sent on a  reconnaisance mission. Two of the bodies were completely charred.
Meanwhile a group of southern organisations in Aden called on the Arab  League to "intervene directly and quickly to end the fighting."
But in Cairo League General Secretary Esmat Abdel Meguid ruled out any  early Arab summit to discuss the crisis. Last week a League emergency meeting  turned down an Egyptian proposal to send an Arab peacekeeping force to Yemen.
An Arab League delegation has been in Yemen since Thursday trying to  broker a ceasefire between Saleh and Baid.
It was also to deliver to Saleh a call from Meguid for an immediate  ceasefire. It was hoped the meeting would be held later Saturday.
Earlier southern military officials said their warplanes were carrying out  raid after raid on the Daleh region in a bid to halt the northern advance.
Northern officials maintained Saturday they had seized the town of  Al-Musaymir, south of Daleh and only 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the  southern air base at Al-Anad.
Journalists said tank and artillery reinforcements had been deployed in  the Al-Musaymir area to bolster the north's forces. Hundreds of civilians have  meanwhile have fled the fighting for the safety of Aden.
Southern leaders also called on the Arab League to intervene to ensure the  implementation of a reconciliation accord signed between the two sides in  February in Amman.
A seven-point peace plan put forward late Friday by the southern Yemen  Socialist Party called on the country's leaders not to give up on the  agreement.
The ceasefire plan which called for an immediate end to fighting was  dismissed as "nothing new" by northern leaders, who in turn repeated demands  for the surrender of the "war criminal" Baid.
Meanwhile a military spokesman in Aden said southern troops were fighting  their northern rivals in the streets of Zinjibar, 60 kilometres (36 miles)  east of Aden to "wipe out pockets of resistance."
He added that the south continued to control the situation at Bab  al-Mandab 130 kilometres (80 miles) west of Aden, on the mouth of the Red Sea.
The south's ceasefire plan on Friday also called for the creation of a  national unity government, prisoners releases and for the right of political  parties to be recognised.
In the latest evacuation of foreigners from the war-torn country, more than  200 nationals of the former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow on a  flight out of Moscow, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said.
The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619 Filipinos, including 40  children and six pregnant women, were still waiting evacuation from Yemen.

Scottish champions Rangers failed to  serve up a champagne finish here on Saturday after being held to a goalless  stalemate by Dundee.
Rangers, without a win for four games before Saturday's encounter, had  hoped to celebrate by thrashing their relegated opponents.
But even Mark Hateley, Scotland's player of the year boasting 28 goals  this season, could not break the deadlock.
Dutchman Pieter Huistra also twice failed from close range, while Rangers'  substitute Alexei Mikhailichenko squandered the game's best chance near the  end when he shot wide from point-blank range after Jim Duffy failed to deal  with Stuart McCall's cross.
Aberdeen finished runners-up to Rangers for the fourth time in five  seasons after drawing 1-1 at home with Celtic.

Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi -- now a minister in South Africa's new government --  Saturday urged his supporters to work for reconciliation and peace with their  political foes.
"Go out and break down the barriers that divide you from your political  opponents," he said in a speech at a rally in KwaZulu-Natal, where his party  trounced the African National Congress (ANC) in the April 26-29 election.
"Go out and spread the word of peace and reconciliation. There can be no  economic development in the region until we achieve peace," he said. "No  businessman will want to invest in this region if his life is in danger. No  investor will want to build factories if their factories are going to be  burned down."
President Nelson Mandela's ANC swept to victory in the national poll, but  lost in Buthelezi's KwaZulu-Natal powerbase. The IFP came third nationally,  after the former ruling National Party and together the three parties make up  the government of national unity that was announced on Wednesday.
In a peace-broking move, Mandela gave Buthelezi the powerful home affairs  ministry in his 27-member cabinet.
The ANC and the IFP have engaged in bloody conflict in KwaZulu-Natal,  where 10,000 people have been killed since 1990.
In his first speech as home affairs minister, Buthelezi said Saturday: "We  will have to to work at political reconciliation if we are to end up with a  national will to make democracy work for the benefit of the people."
The IFP entered the election six days before the poll after holding out in  protest at the new constitution that did not guarantee federalism and Zulu  sovereignty in KwaZulu-Natal.
At the eleventh hour, the IFP was swayed to contest the poll by a deal  committing the new government to enshrine Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's  status in the constitution of the new province of KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu  heartland, and to consolidate that status in the new national constitution.
Before the agreement, thrashed out between the ANC, the former government  and the IFP, the constitution planned to absorb the KwaZulu black homeland  into South Africa and offered no guarantees to the king.
Buthelezi told his supporters it was not going to be easy serving in a  government of national unity made up largely of his erstwhile enemies, but  said he had assured Mandela he would do his best.
"It is not going to be at all easy ... as it is known that the politics of  the ruling party, the ANC, differ in many respects from those of the IFP," he  said, "but I have accepted to serve in that capacity (as a member of the  government) in good faith as long as this will be possible."
"I have, while reserving my position, assured President Mandela of my  cooperation," he said.
He vowed he would continue pushing for his federalist dream, saying it was  the only system of government that would finally rectify the imbalances of  apartheid.
"Soon the IFP will continue our negotiations with the ANC to achieve  federalism," he said. "We are going to be seeking the help of the  international community to resolve the issue once and for all."
"As the constitution now stands, it does not give us the power to rule  this region the way we think best," he said. "Without these powers we are  unable to rule this region effectively."

A supporter of double winners Manchester United was  seriously injured by a missile at the end of United's FA Cup final victory  over Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday.
A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed the news, and added: "There is a  suggestion that he could lose an eye."
The supporter was transferred to the Western Ophthalmic Hospital in  Central London, after first being examined in a West London hospital.
The spokesman said three had been 35 arrests in and around the stadium and  the total was expected to rise after "sporadic minor disorder" around the  ground and surrounding streets.
Thirteen of the 35 arrests were for alleged drunk and disorderly offences.  Six were Chelsea fans, while seven supported United.
Fourteen people were arrested for public order matters, nine Chelsea and  five Manchester United.
There was one arrest for alleged assault, one for possession of drugs -  both United supporters -- while five Chelsea fans were arrested for possessing  missiles.
The disorder came after United won 4-0 with a rush of goals in the second  half.

The UN mission here hit out Saturday at United  Nations Security Council delays in deploying fresh troops in Rwanda, as the  corpses of thousands of victims of the country's ethnic bloodbath surfaced in  neighbouring Uganda.
"A single day's delay is one day too much," said Moctar Gueye, a spokesman  for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) in the capital.
Reduced from 2,500 to around 400, the mission has become powerless to  prevent continuation of the carnage which aid agencies estimate has claimed at  least 200,000 lives in little more than five weeks.
On Friday in New York the Security Council postponed until next week a  vote on the planned deployment of 5,500 additional UN troops.
But Gueye added that he was hopeful that, once authorised, the  reinforcements would be capable of intervening to help secure an end to the  bloodletting.
Meanwhile sporadic bursts of heavy weapons continued in the Rwandan  capital Saturday as rebels fighters battled government troops for control of  the city, Gueye said.
The exchanges between rebels of the mainly minority Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic  Front (RPF) and the Hutu-dominated government forces, were limited to small  arms fire during the afternoon, Gueye said, adding: "The calm will not last."
Separately, health officials in Kampala said Saturday that Ugandans living  on the shores of Lake Victoria had had to bury thousands of corpses flowing  into the lake from Rwanda though the River Kagera.
The officials warned that unless the mass burials were expedited,  epidemics could break out as mutilated, decomposing bodies continued to flood  in.
Ugandan villagers have buried an estimated 26,000 bodies recovered from  the lake during the past three weeks, said Emmanuel Pinto, a deputy from  western Uganda.
The official New Vision newspaper reported on Friday that bodies were  arriving at the rate of 1,600 daily.
The UN World Health Organisation has supplied villagers with grave digging  tools to speed up the macabre exercise.
Earlier Saturday in Kigali, former French minister for humanitarian action  Bernard Kouchner called on the international community to help avert  "genocide" in the country.
"We cannot stand by and let genocide be perpetrated," said Kouchner, a  doctor who founded the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres and who  arrived here on Thursday and spent Friday touring orphanages and camps for  people made homeless by the conflict.
The UN Security Council postponed action on the Rwanda proposal until  early next week after around four hours of discussions.
British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir David Hannay, stressed all  delegates were aware of the urgency of the situation, but a US diplomat said  he believed Washington had not received sufficient details on where the  reinforcements would be deployed.
Diplomatic sources said there were unconfirmed reports that the force  would be composed of troops from Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and  Tanzania, would include 800 troops deployed in Kigali to protect the airport  and other key sites.
Government sources in Canberra said Saturday that at least 10 western  countries, mostly European but including Australia, had been asked to make a  contribution to the new force.
Rwanda was plunged back into a murderous ethnic war on April 7, a day  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in what the government  denounced as a rocket attack on his plane.
Since then an estimated 500,000 Rwandans have fled to neighbouring  countries.
The RPF claimed on Friday it had won control of half the country.

Queensland became the Super 10 rugby  union champions with a convincing 21-10 victory Natal at Kings Park here on  Saturday.
But they were forced to pay a heavy price, with Australian international  centre pairing Tim Horan and Jason Little (knee injuries) and Wallaby flanker  Illie Tabua (ribs) all forced off the field.
Queensland, who led 12-0 at halftime, withstood second half pressure from  the home side before eventually coasting home through tries by winger Barry  Lea and number eight Sam Scott-Young.
Natal responded with a solitary second-half try from Natal left wing  Cabous van der Westhuizen.
Queensland skipper Peter Slattery said: "They came back well in the second  half. There were certain stages when I didn't think we would do it."
But with Natal only two points back at 10-12, Wallaby fly-half Michale  Lynagh slotted a superb drop goal to stretch the score to 15-10.
Lynagh, who ruled much of the game with intelligent kicking, also  converted the Scott-Young try and was successful with two penalties for a  personal points tally of 11.
For Natal, fullback Joubert converted the lone try but otherwise had an  unhappy day with his kicking, landing only one penalty from six attempts.
Natal made far too many mistakes -- two penalties given away in the final  minutes -- and suffered badly in the line-out.
Natal scorers:
Try: Cabous van der Westhuizen. Conversion: Andre Joubert. Penalty:  Joubert.
Queensland scorers:
Tries: Barry Lea, Sam Scott-Young. Conversion: Michael Lynagh. Penalties:  Michael Lynagh (2). Drop-goal: Lynagh.

Federal Police narcotics agents seized 300  kilos (660 pounds) of marijuana and 60 cases of heavy arms munitions during a  roadside raid, said police Saturday.
Authorities found the contraband Friday hidden in the rear of a truck  stopped at a fueling station some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the center of  Rio.
According to police, the drugs were bound for Rio's "favelas", the slums  surrounding the city. Police believe the shipment entered Brazil from Paraguay.

New Zealand produced a dismal showing against  Middlesex at Lord's on Saturday to fall to 100 for nine, though rain saved  them as the match was drawn.
Manager Geoff Howarth once again criticised his batsmen for their second  hopeless showing against the English county champions in the same week.
"It's not good enough," said the former Test captain after New Zealand had  crashed to 101 for nine. "People have got to get their act together and start  producing the goods."
Howarth blasted the Kiwis last weekend at Taunton where they were made to  follow-on by Somerset following a collapse to 182 all out.
Saturday's effort was even worse, with eight second innings wickets  falling for 31 in the space of 14 overs before lunch.
"We've done a lot of talking about the need for consistency," added  Howarth. "But sometimes talking is not enough. The experienced players have to  pull their weight and start playing as I know they can.
"This is the fourth innings out of six in first-class matches on this tour  when we've lost a stack of wickets in one session. We've got to toughen up. At  the moment positions one to 11 are a problem!"
Martin Crowe spared New Zealand's blushes against Somerset by hitting a  second innings century. But with their best batsman missing this game, there  was no-one to rescue them.
They started the final day in reasonable shape -- 127 runs ahead and with  nine wickets in hand. One wretched shot after another rapidly changed the  picture, however, and Middlesex were on course to pocket a 4,000 pound cheque  from match sponsors Tetley Bitter until rain washed out their victory hopes.
Blair Hartland drove Kevin Shine weakly to cover, Mark Greatbatch edged  19-year-old paceman Richard Johnson into the slip cordon and Shane Thomson  perished lbw to Middlesex's impressive teenager.
Stephen Fleming, who scored a stylish 118 not out in the first innings,  contributed just five this time before tamely cutting Shine to backward-point,  while Adam Parore was run out by Jason Pooley's direct hit from cover.
But worst of all was the way captain Ken Rutherford surrendered his wicket  after moving to 23 with the help of five boundaries. He followed a delivery  from Chas Taylor and inexplicably dabbed it into the gloves of Keith Brown.
With Matthew Hart deflecting an attempted forward defensive against Taylor  onto his stumps and Gavin Larsen losing an lbw decision to Mark Feltham, New  Zealand were a humiliating 73 for nine.
And that was against an attack minus Angus Fraser, Neil Williams, Phil  Tufnell and John Emburey.

Al Unser Jnr overcame a slow first  lap to capture the early pole position for the 78th Indianapolis 500 here  Saturday.
Unser, the 1992 Indy 500 champion, completed a four-lap qualifying run on  the 2.5-mile (4km) oval at 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h) to lead 13 qualifiers  before rain halted time trials after two hours.
Morning rain that delayed the start of qualifying kept Unser cautious on  his first lap, achieving only 225.722 mph (361.115 km/h). But his next three  laps were the fastest so far in time trials, increasing on each circuit and  peaking at 229.481 mph (367.169 km/h).
"I ran into that rain in turn one this morning in practice and it scared  the heck out of me," Unser said. "I wanted to check out the car and make sure  everything was working all right."
Unser's car owner, Roger Penske, was pleased with the reliability of the  Mercedes engine, which has dominated practice all month.
"Al never really had a chance to run it hard into turn one and he likes to  make sure everything is all right," Penske said. "The next three laps were  oustanding though."
Brazil's Raul Boesel and Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve were on the  early front row beside Unser, with Michael Andretti, Nigel Mansell and Arie  Luyendyk in row two.
England's Nigel Mansell, the reigning Indy-car series champion, was fifth  fastest at 224.041 mph (358.465 km/h). His run came less than five minutes  before the rain stopped qualifying.
"The car was running slower," Mansell said. "As the front came in, there  was more humidity in the air and it slowed us down a bit. I'm just happy we  got the run in and we can concentrate on the race."

Rain delayed the start of qualifying for 75 minutes after 25 cars set  their top practice speeds in a rain-shortened warmup session.
Penske racer Paul Tracy, injured in a practice crash Friday, was released  from Methodist Hospital here Saturday but not cleared to drive by speedway  officials. Penske team officials said Tracy would not comment until he is  declared fit for qualifying.
"He's disappointed, but the goal is to get one car on the pole," Penske  said. "I'm just glad he can run whenever we get to qualify again."

Some 300 people demonstrated against  racism in this east German town Saturday after a rampage against Africans on  Thursday, and some 200 demonstrated in Berlin.
The demonstrations were calm.
The Jewish community and the press united meanwhile in denouncing the  police for incompetence in their handling of the violence, when gangs of  skinheads banded together to hunt down foreigners, most of them Africans.
Around 50 youths, armed with sticks and knives, turned on a group of  Africans before launching a full-scale manhunt through the streets. According  to police up to 150 youths took part in the violence, in which three people  were injured.
One, a German, was in a coma Saturday and had been operated on for cranial  bleeding, police said.
"I do not understand how this could have happened. It is a scandal that  the police did not manage to protect these people," the president of the  central council of Jews in German, Ignatz Bubis, told the daily Express in an  interview.
The Cologne daily, Koelnische Rundschau, reflected the sentiment of many  newspapers when it asked: "Who is in charge of patrolling Magdeburg? The  police or nightwatchmen?"
Criticism of the local authorities has been all the harsher because the  local department of public prosecutions has since freed all but one of the 50  arrested.
"We cannot for the moment prove that they were involved," prosecutor  Rudolf Jaspers said on Saturday. "All those taken in for questioning  maintained that they were only spectators."
"It was like being back in the worst era of the SA (the main Nazi militia  up to 1934)," the government official responsible for immigrants and foreign  workers, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen said, who saw the events in Magdeburg as a  "horrible climax" to the xenophobic violence, which has flared in Germany  since reunification.
"This manhunt marks a new level of violence," according to Klaus  Hurrelmann, a professor at the university of Bielefeld and expert on  extreme-right movements.
Since unification in 1990 dozens of people have been killed, victims of  right-wing violence ranging from attacks on immigrant hostels in Rostock to  arson attacks in Moelln and Solingen on the homes of Turks, in addition to  almost daily isolated assaults on foreigners.
"I cannot conceive how the police allowed these criminals to go after only  checking on their identities," said Bubis, who has often spoken out against  what he sees as laxity on the part of the authorities in dealing with the  extreme-right.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, in response to public  outrage at seeking a band of skinheads attack foreigners in broad daylight  with impunity, has called an emergency meeting of the committee on legislation  in the lower house for Monday.
It is proposing that police be given powers to hold suspects in custody  for longer without pressing charges and for stiffer penalties for those  convicted of racist attacks.
But it could run into opposition from the Liberal FDP, which maintains  that existing legislation is sufficient so long as it is firmly implemented.

Georgian and Abkhazian authorities signed an  agreement Saturday on a ceasefire and deployment of an intervention force in  the troubled separarist republic, the Russian foreign ministry said.
The accord, signed by both sides under mediation from Moscow, would  "prevent the resumption of military action and facilitate the return of  (Georgian) refugees to their homes," the ITAR-TASS agency quoted the ministry  as saying.
The agency gave no other details on the mechanics of the accord, but  sources close to the negotiations said disagreements remained over the future  status of Abkhazia and conditions covering refugees, with the separatists only  willing to accept the return of Georgians who took no part in the fighting.
The signing came a day after the Georgian parliament refused to ratify the  accord.
The deputies feared the accord, which calls for deploying Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) troops in a 12-kilometre (seven-mile) buffer zone  separating Abkhazia from the rest of the country, would lend increased  authority to Abkhazia's claims to independence, which Georgia rejects.
In protest at the parliamentary snub, President Eduard Shevardnadze  offered his resignation Friday and proposed abolishing the presidency.
The Russian foreign ministry added that the Russian government was certain  "the warring parties will strictly honour their commitments."
It said: "Russia is ready, together with the United Nations, to contribute  to securing a global solution to the conflict and to ensure the current stage  is followed by fresh efforts to reestablish order in the region."
An earlier bilateral truce accord signed April 4 in Moscow failed to come  into effect.
Despite opposition from UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to   Russia's attempts to act as a peacekeeper within the CIS, Moscow has stepped  up efforts to secure a settlement to the conflict since signing a major  friendship and cooperation accord with Tbilisi on February 3.
Between August 1992 and September 1993, fighting between Georgian and  Abkhazian forces claimed several thousand lives, while more than 200,000  Abkhazia-based Georgians were forced to flee their homes.

A compromise over Formula One safety measures could  be on the cards after the sport's teams and drivers met here on Saturday.
World governing body FIA announced sweeping changes following the deaths  of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at the San Marino grand prix and the  accident here which left Austrian Karl Wendlinger in a coma.
Saturday's meeting, chaired by President of the Formula One Constructors'  Association Bernie Ecclestone, is to pave the way for more meetings here on  Monday between team mechanics and owners.
They will discuss if the safety changes can be introduced within FIA's  deadline and are confident the governing body can be persuaded to relax its  tight schedule.
The drivers, who have just revived the drivers' association, were  represented on Saturday by former world champion Nicki Lauda, Gerhard Berger,  Michael Schumacher and Christian Fittipaldi.
FIA orginally announced cars would need to be radically adapted by the  grand prix in Spain (May 29), Canada (June 12) and Germany (July 31). Measures  include cutting speed and downforce on the cars, with more protection for  drivers.

Paris and London pursued a flurry of diplomatic  activity Saturday to defuse a major row between the French government and  British carriers over landing rights at the capital's Orly airport.
Both countries' transport ministers were in regular contact by telephone  Friday and Saturday in search of a solution to the "sky wars" standoff sparked  after Paris refused to allow three carriers headed by British Airways (BA) to  start a service from London to Orly from next Monday, according to a spokesman  in London.
BA threatened Friday to sue the French government if it stopped the  company's  flights, while French aviation authorities were reported ready to  reject the British carriers' flight plans.
Aides of French Transport Minister Bernard Bresson refused Saturday to  give details of the state of negotiations, while a spokesman for his British  counterpart John McGregor would only confirm that the talks between the two  men were continuing.
Bosson earlier described the affair as a "storm in a teacup" and predicted  that "everything will be back in order" by Monday.
BA plus two other airlines -- TAT and Air UK -- are insisting with British  government backing that they are entitled to start flights to Orly Monday in  line with a European Commission ruling last month.
But French authorities have been barring British flights to the airport in  defiance of the decision that ordered France to open three domestic routes --  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles -- to competition.
Seven flights out of London are still scheduled to land at Orly Monday,  but any crews flyinbg without accepted flight plans would violate  international air traffic regulations and place passengers at risk.
A BA spokesman said earlier that the company would consider seeking  compensation if not allowed to land Monday but did not specify whether the  carrier would take immediate action.
Bosson has cited congestion at Orly, environmental considerations and  increased access to London's Heathrow airport for French carriers as issues  which need to be resolved before the route is opened.
It is understood that France offered a compromise by suggesting it was  prepared to open Orly to British carriers at the end of June.
British Airways has said: "We have the rights and the slots, and we will  be starting our first London-to-Orly flights on Monday."
Air UK has also stated that it would be "going ahead on Monday."
A fourth UK airline -- British Midland -- has delayed the start of its  four-flights-a-day Heathrow-Orly service until the row is resolved.

Twelve people were massacred by gunmen in  Tokoza black township east of here late Friday, in the most violent incident  since South Africa's first non-racial election last month.
The gunmen, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, stormed a house and opened  fire on the occupants, killing 12, police spokeswoman Janine Smith told the  domestic news agency SAPA. The victims were aged between 13 and 25.
Smith said it appeared the youths had been staying in the house for about  a month, but police did not know if they had been affiliated to any political  group.
Last year at least 1,600 people were killed in the townships east of here,  which have borne the brunt of political violence.
The death toll has steadily declined since the beginning of the year and  police told of experiencing their quietest time in years over the April 26-29  election which was won by President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress  (ANC).
Mandela was inaugurated as the country's first democratically-elected  president on Tuesday, ending more than 300 years of white-minority rule.
In his first statement, new Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi  Saturday condemned the Tokoza killings, saying they were contrary to the  spirit of reconciliation.
"These barbaric killings are made all the more shocking due to the spirit  of reconciliation and peace which emerged after the elections," Mufamadi said  in a statement.
"They serve as a grim reminder that violence and its contributing factors  will have to be combated with all the resources at the disposal of the  government of national unity," he said, vowing that eradicating violence would  be a top priority of the police force.
In a pre-dawn swoop Saturday, police and soldiers raided three migrant  worker hostels in Vosloorus, near Tokoza, and seized a cache of arms,  including 13 AK-47s, three handgrenades and more than 1,000 rounds of  ammunition, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) said in a  statement.
"Several" people were arrested on a range of charges, the SANDF said.
Most of the township violence has pitted hostel dwellers, mainly supporters  of the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), against ANC-supporting  township residents.
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's IFP came third in the election, after the former  ruling National Party (NP); members of the ANC, NP and IFP make up the  government of national unity that was announced on Wednesday.
The ANC and the IFP have been waging a virtual civil war for political  dominance in Johannesburg's eastern township and KwaZulu-Natal province that  has claimed 7,000 lives since 1990.
In a move to broker peace between the warring parties, Mandela this week  gave the powerful home affairs ministry to Buthelezi. The IFP was also granted  two other places in the 27-member cabinet.

Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is to meet  PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Oslo in the coming week, Israeli state television  said Saturday.
The two men have been invited by the Norwegian government to take part in  a ceremony marking the secret negotiations held between Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organisation in Oslo in early 1993 which eventually led  to the accord on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
Former US president Jimmy Carter, who co-sponsored the first agreement  between Israel and an Arab country in 1979 which led to peace with Egypt, has  also been invited to attend.

Former spokeswoman for the PLO's negotiating  team Hanan Ashrawi has refused to participate in the 24-strong Palestinan  Authority for Gaza and Jericho, Israeli television said late Saturday.
According to the television, she has told Palestine Liberation  Organisation leader Yasser Arafat that she would prefer to retain her duties  as head of an organisation to defend civil rights in the occupied territories  rather than be a member of the new self-rule authority.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was given a partial list of names of  the 15 members of the new body on Thursday including Ashrawi.
PLO chief negotiator Nabil Shaath said the authority would be ready to  take up its duties on Wednesday.
Israeli television said Arafat had appointed two other members Saturday --  Nablus businessman Munib al-Masri and university professor Sari Nussiebeh.
The appointments were formally approved in Tunis at a meeting of the PLO's  executive commitee which also nominated Yasser Abed Rabbo, head of the PLO's  information department, to the authority, a committee member Mohammed Zohdi  Nashashibi told AFP in Tunis.
However, sources close to Rabbo said he had not given his formal approval  to his nomination and had asked for time to think about it.

Syrian President Hafez al-Assad persuaded Lebanese  Prime Minister Rafic Hariri to resume his duties after a week-long boycott of  government meetings in a row over a planned cabinet reshuffle, a source close  to the premier said Saturday.
Hariri froze his duties last Sunday, angry that plans to increase the  number of Christians in his cabinet had been blocked by President Elias Hraoui.
But after a three hour meeting with Assad in Damascus, Hariri was  persuaded to return to his duties, the source added.
A cabinet meeting is due to be held Monday to confirm Hariri's decision.
The issue of a cabinet reshuffle will be discussed with Syrian leaders  after a visit by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher due to begin Sunday,  the source added.

Auxerre, inspired by striker Gerard Baticle,  clinched their first major honour of the club's history as they thrashed  Montpellier 3-0 in the French Cup final here on Saturday.
Guy Roux's side, whose only brush with glory came in a losing cup final  appearance in 1979, were always in control, with Baticle scoring the crucial  second and setting up the other two goals.
Montpellier's villain was right back Bertrand Reuzeau, who gifted Baticle  his goal three minutes after half-time.
The defender's back pass fell agonisingly short and Baticle shot across  Claude Barrabe.
The first goal, stabbed home on the rebound by mifielder Moussa Saib, came  after Baticle's low cross from the left was fumbled by the goalkeeper and  Baticle popped up on the right in the closing stages to cross for captain  Corentin Martins to finish.
Martins earned his score after hitting a curling free-kick onto the  crossbar in the first half with Barrabe well beaten.

The militant Islamic group Jamaa Islamiyya said  Saturday it had shot dead three policemen and wounded a fourth in the Asyut  region, a fundamentalist stronghold in southern Egypt.
A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said that Friday's two  attacks were "part of a series planned to revenge the murder" on April 25 of  Talaat Yassin, the organisation's military leader.
It added they were also a warning to those who "killed the martyr Abdel  Hareth Madani" who died in detention at the end of April.
On Thursday the public prosecutor's office said initial autopsies showed  Madani had been tortured to death.
But on Saturday the Egyptian interior ministry said the 32-year-old lawyer  had died from an asthma attack befor he was even questioned about allegations  that he was acting as a go-between for jailed Jamaa members and those abroad.
Egyptian authorities have opened an inquiry into the affair which has been  condemned by the US-based human rights organisation Human Rights/Middle East  Watch.
Two policemen were killed Friday and one wounded when gunmen opened fire  at conscripts guarding a police station in Badari, near Abu Tig, 400  kilometers (240 miles) south of Cairo.
A few hours later another was shot dead as he stepped out of his home in  Abu Tig.
The latest killings bring to 138 the number of policemen murdered since  Islamic militants launched a campaign to topple President Hosni Mubarak two  years ago. The campaign has also cost the lives of 144 militants.

Rescuers struggled late Saturday to  salvage a cargo of dangerous acids from the English Channel lost from a  sinking container vessel after it collided with another ship, maritime  officials said.
The Ming Fortune, of Taiwan, lost several of its containers overboard  after colliding with the refrigeration vessel Ariake, the French maritime  emergency centre here reported.
The ship was transporting dangerous substances including acids.
Rescuers were seeking to recover as many of the containers as possible  before nightfall, the centre said, adding that the operation would resume  Sunday with the help of French and British helicopters.
Earlier Saturday helicopters winched the 21 crew members of the Taiwanese  container vessel to the nearby Maltese cargo ship Steersman, which took them  to England.
The centre said the Ming Fortune was sinking after being badly holed in  the collision, adding that its captain and chief engineer had remained on  board to try to save the vessel and guide French and British salvage teams.
British coastguards said all members of both ships' crews had been  accounted for.
The Ariake, carrying a cargo of fruit, was taken under tow by the merchant  vessel Aberthauw toward Britain.
The collision between the Ming Fortune and the Ariake, which was variously  described as Japanese- and Panamanian-registered, occurred Saturday afternoon  in thick fog inside waters for which France has responsibility.
The French centre said the circumstances of the collision were unclear,  but added that human error was almost certainly a factor. A probe into the  incident has been launched.
It was the fifth such accident in the Channel or North Sea in five years.

Former Formula One flop Michael  Andretti backed FIA's decision to go ahead with Sunday's Monaco grand prix  following Karl Wendlinger's horror crash and the deaths of Ayrton Senna and  Roland Ratzenberger.
Andretti, who quit McLaren after less than one season after failing to  repeat his IndyCar success in Formula One, said in the run-up to the  Indianapolis 500 here: "To cancel one race, what would that accomplish? Karl  Wendlinger wouldn't want the race cancelled if he was on the other side of it.
"If you're going to cancel Monaco, you might as well cancel the rest of  the year. The problem is not the races.
"It's that the neck and shoulder protection need to be improved."

Jaguar Cars Limited have filed a  lawsuit against the National Football League claiming the new Jacksonville  Jaguars team logo is too similar to the automobile maker's pouncing cat.
The suit, filed in US District Court in New York, charges the NFL violated  trademark laws when they developed the logo.
"Quite frankly, I'm surprised they came up with the logo," said Jaguar  Cars spokesman John Crawford. "There is likely confusion among consumers  because of the similarity of the logo.
"We have nothing against the use of the name Jacksonville Jaguars," he  said, but added, "We vigorously pursue trademark infringement in Australia,  England, anywhere in the world."
The new team's logo has already been emblazoned on thousands of T-shirts,  bumper stickers and other merchandise.
A team spokesman said the club do not believe the symbol infringes on  Jaguar Cars' trademark. The NFL have yet to comment on the suit.

Barcelona were crowned Spanish champions here on  Saturday for the fourth season in a row after beating Sevilla 5-2.
That gave them 56 points to draw alongside Deportivo La Coruna, who could  only draw 0-0 with Valencia. Barcelona won the title because they scored 3  goals to 1 in the clubs' two meetings this season.

The Moslem-dominated Bosnian army has captured a  strategic hill northwest of Tuzla after a three-day battle against Serb  forces, the Nordic Battalion of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) reported  Saturday.
The situation was calm Saturday, Major Thomas Aersson told AFP from Tuzla,  a major government-held town in the north. He said the hill was near Mount  Ozren.
Radio Sarajevo reported that government troops captured five villages in  the region Thursday, near Gracanica, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) northwest  of Tuzla.
Serb forces meanwhile closed the main road between Sarajevo airport and  the centre of the capital Saturday afternoon after one of their men was  seriously wounded by a sniper at a checkpoint on the road, an UNPROFOR officer  said.
The airport, which is under the control of the French Foreign Legion, can  also be reached via the suburb of Dobrinja but the UN forces avoid that route  because it entails their armoured cars snaking through winding, densely  populated streets.
France's ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina, Henri Jacolin, paid a visit  Saturday to 11 French aid workers under arrest by Bosnian Serbs since April 8  on charges of smuggling weapons to the government forces.
He told AFP he had taken "food, newspapers and clothes" to the 11, held by  Serb troops in Lukavica, an outlying suburb of Sarajevo.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said earlier this week he would find  a legal formula to allow the men to be freed, but Jacolin said he had been  unable to obtain any new details on when they might be released.

Houdini artists Barcelona pulled off yet another  miracle escape here on Saturday to win their fourth Spanish league title in a  row.
Johan Cruyff's side, who are also in the European Cup final, have now won  their last three championships on the final day of the Spanish season.
But they cut it fine this time, winning on goal difference after thrashing  Sevilla 5-2 while long-time leaders Deportivo La Coruna slipped up at Valencia.
Their 0-0 stalemate allowed Barcelona to join them on 56 points and steal  the title after scoring three goals to Deportivo's one in their two league  fixtures during the campaign.
Barcelona, who pipped Real Madrid to the crown in the final hours of the  preceding two seasons, went behind 1-0 and then 2-1, after Argentinian Diego  Simeone (12th minute) and Croatian Davor Suker (44) had given the visitors an  early advantage.
But the home side were put on the road to victory by Bulgarian Hristo  Stoichkov, who netted in the 20th and 49th minutes to level.
Brazilian Romario then scored his 30th goal of the season with 20 minutes  remaining and Michael Laudrup (74) and Jose Maria Bakero (88) put the icing on  the cake in the final quarter.
Deportivo's agony was deepened by the fact that they had been on top of  the league for 25 weeks -- and that the title would have given their first  domestic trophy in their history.
But this time their Brazilian striker Bebeto, with 16 goals to his credit  this season, fired blanks.

But Cruyff will be determined to go one better by beating AC Milan of  Italy in the European Cup on Wednesday, May 18 and repeat the club's 1992  success in Europe's premier club competition.

Derek Harper of the New York Knicks was suspended  for two games and Chicago's Jo Jo English for one for their parts in a bench  clearing brawl in the National Basketball Association playoffs Friday night.
In addition, Harper was fined 15,000 dollars and English was fined 10,000  dollars. Seven other Knicks and eight other Bulls were fined 2,500 dollars  apiece for leaving their benches.
The fight melee occurred in the second quarter of Chicago's 104-102  victory that narrowed the gap in the best-of-seven second round series to 2-1.
Game four is scheduled for Chicago Stadium on Sunday, and game five is on  Wednesday in New York.
The trouble started when England and Harper shoved each other on the  court. Harper then punched English and threw him t the floor.
The benches emptied and players and coaches piled on top of ech other in  the front row seats. At least three women fans were shoved aside and then  fallen on.
Both Knicks coach Pat Riley and Bulls coach Phil Jackson were knocked down.
Announcing the fines and suspensions, NBA vice president Rod Thorn said:  "There is no place for fighting in the NBA, and when an incident endangers the  welfare of the fans who come out and see our games, we are especially  concerned. These actions will not be tolerated."
Harper's absence will be a big blow for the Knicks, but the three-time  defending champion Bulls have another problem -- a dispute between veteran  Scottie Pippen and Jackson.
Pippen, the mainstay of the Bulls since the departure of Michael Jordan  last autumn, refused to take the court in the closing seconds of Friday  night's game.
Neither Pippen nor Jackson would discuss the incident on Saturday, but  Pippen appeared to be upset that the play called during a time-out with 1.8  seconds left in the game was designed for Toni Kukoc.
Kukoc took the inbound pass and made a 19-foot turnaround shot to give the  Bulls a 104-102 victory.
A loss would have put them within one game of elimination.
The narrow victory came after the Bulls blew a 22-point second-half lead.

Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty clung on to the lead in the  Spanish Open here in stormy conditions after surviving a 36-hole endurance  test and a two-pronged attack from Colin Montgomeries and Mark Roe.
The 40-year-old McNulty, finishing off a morning 69 to lead after a  weather-interupted second round, then added a 70 to get to 207, while European  number one Montgomerie shot a best-of-the-week 66.
Roe, meanwhile, produced a 69 after springing into contention for the  83,000-pound title by scoring seven birdies in a morning 68.
But McNulty's steadiness under pressure and his smooth putting stroke  proved invaluable.
"It had been a very long two days and I shall be going straight to bed,"  he said. "I will be looking forward to the last round and I have a strong will  to win."
Scot Montgomerie used his third new putter in as many rounds, having  brought five with him to Spain in the hope of finding a cure to his inability  to sink anything longer than four feet.
The latest worked so well that he made five birdies in an outward 31 which  included a chip-in from ten yards at the ninth.
Langer, twcie a Spanish champion, played faultlesss golf in his evening 69  to be the dangerman at eight under, alongside England's Richard Boxall.
But Jose Maria Olazabal, the new US Masters champion, is not out of the  hunt. He sank a 30-foot putt at the last for a 69 to take seventh spot on a  six under 210.
The second round was completed 21 hours behind schedule after the second  half of the field got round on Saturday morning without undue difficulty.

Hideshi Matsuda spent the past two  years watching the Indianapolis 500 as a Japanese television commentator.
Now he's part of the show.
Matsuda became only the second Japanese driver to make the 33-car field by  qualifying here Saturday.
"This is the happiest moment of my life," Matsuda said. "It's just like a  dream. I knew I wanted this two years ago when I came as a reporter. Since  then, I have dreamed of it every day."
Matsuda, this year's oldest Indy rookie at age 39, joins Hiro Matsushita  as the only Japanese starters here. Matsushita, trying for his third Indy  start, was waiting in line Saturday when rain ended time trials early.
Rain affected Matsuda as well. He was the first driver in line for a  qualifying run on the 2.5-mile (4km) oval, but had to sit through a rain delay  of 75 minutes. That added to the tension when Matsuda finally took the track,  zooming past 150,000 spectators screaming their support.
"I was very nervous because of the waiting and the weather," Matsuda said.  "But once I got into the car, that feeling disappeared. I stepped (the  accelerator) all the way to the floor and kept it there."
Matsuda had four consistent laps and qualified his 1993 Lola-Cosworth at  222.545 mph (356.072 km/h), briefly making him the fastest rookie in Indy 500  history.
"I was hoping to go even a little bit faster," said Matsuda, whose mark  was surpassed later by Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve.
---
Matsuda began racing at age 20 in go-carts, with Mario Andretti as his  idol. By qualifying, he should get the chance to race alongside Andretti in  the veteran's final Indy start.
After his first racing season, Matsuda took an insurance job and did not  race again until age 28. He went on to drive Formula 3 cars.
"My parents wanted me to become a doctor, but I just wanted to be a race  driver," he said.
Matsuda's wife Yoshiko is the sister of Beat Takeshi, a Japanese comedian  who convinced Matsuda to take his love of Indy seriously. After assembling  enough sponsor money for a car, Matsuda made his dreams reality.
"The intensity was the same here as racing in Japan," he said. "The thing  that bothered me was the turbulence."

The highest US military decoration  will be awarded to two soldiers killed in Somalia last year, President Bill  Clinton said Saturday.
Sergeants Gary Gordon and Randall Shughart will be posthumously decorated  with the Medal of Honor during a White House ceremony May 23 -- the first time  the medal will have been awarded since the Vietnam War.
The soldiers were killed while attempting to reach other Army Rangers who  were critically wounded when their helicopter was downed in Mogadishu in  October, according to a White House statement.
The two came under heavy fire from forces loyal to Somali warlord Mohammed  Aidid as they fought their way through a dense maze of shacks in Mogadishu,  armed only with rifles.
They ran out of ammuntion and were fatally wounded but managed to deliver  a rifle to the helicopter pilot who then reached safety.
"By their extraordinary heroism, Sergeants Gordon and Shughart managed to  save the pilot's life," said the statement issued in Indiana, where Clinton  attended a Democratic governors' convention.
The Medal of Honor is awarded for "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidy at  the risk of live above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy."

Racial prejudice and dire predictions about  floods of refugees from neighboring Haiti have become major themes in the  closing hours of the Dominican Republic's presidential elections.
In a final push before Monday's elections, President Joaquin Balaguer is  trumpeting his own birth in the Dominican Republic and portraying his black  opponent, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, as a voodoo practitioner.
Anonymous fliers have been circulated saying Pena Gomez, the chief rival  for the presidency, is the "son of Haitians."
And Balaguer's Christian Social Reformist Party has said that Pena Gomez,  who represents the Democratic Revolutionary Party, plans to open refugee camps  for Haitians in hopes of ingratiating himself with the United States.
Another presidential candidate is claiming that the ruling powers of the  Dominican Republic want to use cheap Haitian labor at the cost of jobs for  their own people.
Haiti is both scorned and feared in the Dominican Republic, which shares  the eastern half of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
The reasons for this are both racial and economic.
Haiti is overwhelmingly black, while the Dominican Republic is 75 percent  mulatto, 15 percent white and 10 percent black. But the 87-year-old Balaguer  is also playing on Dominicans' fears that Haitians fleeing their impoverished  country will flood across the border.
The fear is real in this country, which is home to about 500,000 illegal  Haitian immigrants and where about 30 percent of the population is unemployed.
In a recent speech, Balaguer attacked Pena Gomez without naming him,  saying that "from outside or inside the government I will also serve the  country because I am proud of having been born in the Dominican Republic."
A third candidate, Jacobo Majutla of the Independent Revolutionary Party,  claimed the "oligarchy of the country prefers to hire Haitians for  agricultural and (sugar) cane-cutting work because it is cheaper and this  hurts our nation."
Balaguer, who is seeking his seventh term in office, is a wily campaigner  and despite being almost blind enjoys considerable support.
Pena Gomez has accused Balaguer of planning to take the vote by fraud if  necessary.
On Saturday he vowed he would "bury" his rival in the ballot box. "For  them it is intolerable that a citizen of color could reach the presidency,"  Pena Gomez said in a speech to a crowd of supporters, but "with a wave of  votes we are going to bury forever 'Balaguerismo.'"
All the presidential contenders have promised to turn to the needs of the  poorest in this country of seven million people, especially bringing clean  water, health care and public transport.
Around 30 people have died in political violence during street protests  and rallies for the poll. But there were no deaths in the last week of  campaigning and both Balaguer and Pena Gomez are urging peace.
Per capital income is about 790 dollars annually while about 20 percent of  the population is illiterate. Neighboring Haiti is the poorest country in the  western hemisphere.

Honda's new Indy-car engine proved  uncompetitive during Indianapolis 500 qualifying Saturday, prompting  complaints from drivers using the Japanese-made motors.
"I'm coming back here next year with tried and true," vowed Bobby Rahal,  who along with Mike Groff were the two slowest of 13 qualifiers for the May 29  race.
"I'm not here to trot around at the back. I'm here to win races," Rahal  said.
Groff struggled during a week of practice with engine failures before  qualifying slowest at 218.808 mph (350.092 km/h). Rahal was slightly better  over the four-lap qualifying run on the 2.5-mile (4km) oval, with an average  speed of 220.178 mph (352.284 km/h).
"I was flat out for four laps and it was some of the best speed I have had  all month," Rahal said.
Once the 33-car field is full, racers begin bumping the slowest qualified  cars to make the starting lineup. That makes Rahal and Groff the top targets,  forcing them to concentrate on having backup cars set to requalify instead of  planning for race day.
Honda engineers have examined every failed engine from Indy and said they  have identified problems they could solve in later designs. But that is little  comfort for Groff and Rahal.
"When you are flat out there is not much more you can do," Groff said.  "There was really no more left."
"I'm not pleased with it, but I know they will keep working on it," Rahal  said. "If they are tried and true next year, I will be back with it."
Indy-car series champion Nigel Mansell, who drove Honda-powered cars to a  Formula One crown, said patience is needed while Honda learns from its  mistakes.
"I'm surprised they are as far off here as they appear to be," Mansell  said. "They adapted very quickly in Formula One. They have the capability to  do whatever they want. It's just a matter of priorities and what they want to  do first."

The European Union (EU) is trying to overcome  final hitches to ambitious trade, cooperation and partnership agreements with  Russia and Ukraine, European diplomats said at the weekend.
They were speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday  which could endorse the accord with Russia and agree on the formal signing of  a similar deal with Ukraine which was initialled in March.
The two agreements give greater access to western European markets, open  up the prospect of free trade areas after 1997 if market reforms are  implemented, and provide for greater political dialogue.
In Moscow's case, Russia is also acknowledged to be an economy in  transition towards a free market, rather than state-controlled. This is a  significant concession translating into better trade prospects.
But hardnosed bargaining by Russia involving its nuclear fuel exports and  restrictions on foreign banks has held up the EU-Russian agreement for more  than a year.
And some EU countries are reluctant to sign the accord with Ukraine before   Kiev fulfills its agreement last January to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
The EU's executive European Commission said that it had reached "agreement  in principle" with Moscow, including compromises on the nuclear fuel and  banking issues which must still be endorsed by several reluctant EU countries.
France in particular objects to allowing Russia's exports of nuclear fuels  such as enriched uranium to benefit from the accord, despite a clause which  would let the EU block surges of dumped Russian uranium.
"The issue is complicated because US companies have secured an extremely  good deal with Russia, so the Russian nuclear materials could be dumped on  Europe," a British official said.
He also reported general EU discontent with a Russian insistence that  foreign banks in Russia should be allowed no more than 12 percent of the  capitalisation of the Russian banking system.
However, a diplomat here quipped that this issue was unlikely to derail  the accord since "I'm not sure there is a flood of banks rushing to go (to  Russia) given the exciting Mafia situation there."
Also on Monday's agenda is a debate over whether the accord with Ukraine  should be delayed as a lever to make Kiev meet its January commitment to  dismantle its nuclear arsenal inherited from the Soviet Union.
And the EU ministers will discuss a proposal that western nations should  pay for the close-down of Ukraine's dangerous Chernobyl nuclear power station  and replace it with at least two new power stations.
Ukraine is asking for more than three billion dollars to do this -- "a very  large price," one EU diplomat remarked.
But the alternative is even more chilling -- a repeat of the world's  worst-ever nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl plant in 1986.
The issue will feature prominently on the agenda of the G-7 summit of  industrialised countries -- Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and  the United States -- in Naples in July.
The EU has acknowledged that Ukraine, a country roughly the size of France  and formerly known as the Soviet Union's breadbasket, is in desperate need of  aid to prop up a sharply-declining economy and avoid social break-down.
But Michael Stuermer, an advisor to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  suggested in an address here Tuesday that promises of western aid were too  late and that Ukrainian independence would soon exist only on paper.
"In economic terms Ukraine will slip inexorably and helplessly into the  fold of Greater Russia. ... Control of Ukraine (for Russia) means the  difference between a second-rate role in Europe and an empire of global  reach," he said.

Helen Lee Mei, a leading lady in Hong  Kong's film industry during the 1950s and 1960s, has died at age 63.
She died Thursday of cancer and pulmonary disease in Portland, Oregon.
Lee had top billing in all her 37 feature films and in 1960 became the  first foreign actress to star in a play at Tokyo's all-female Takarazuka  Theater.
She was born July 27, 1930 and left Hong Kong in 1967 to marry a US  Central Intelligence Agency officer she met in Taiwan. They divorced in 1982  but had been planning to remarry in June.

President Bill Clinton invoked the  memories of two slain civil rights leaders Saturday in a call for an end to  the crime and violence that is horrifying Americans.
Standing on the spot where the late Senator Robert Kennedy appealed to a  crowd for calm and understanding on the night of black activist Martin Luther  King's assassination in 1968, Clinton addressed a ground-breaking ceremony for  a monument to the two slain activists and called for reconciliation.
"We just witnessed a miracle in South Africa. We hope we are witnessing a  miracle in the Middle East," he told the crowd braving a steady downpour in  Indianapolis, Indiana.
"Everywhere in the world people have looked to us for an example," he  said. "And I ask you today, have we created that miracle here at home?"
Clinton lamented Americans' growing alarm about rising crime rates,  mentioning a Washington housing project where guards were hired and a fence  erected to keep criminals out.
"That isn't the kind of freedom our forefathers conceived of 200 years  ago; not the kind of freedom that Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy gave  their lives for," he said.
"On that awful night 26 years ago, Robert Kennedy beckoned Americans of  all races to show compassion and wisdom in the face of violence and  lawlessness," Clinton said.
The president called on Americans "to renew the society we live in today.  It must inspire us to overcome racial, social and political divisions."
Clinton's remarks came as Congress is putting the final touches on a  wide-ranging crime bill which will increase the application of the death  penalty and put more police on patrol.
The "Landmark for Peace" memorial for King and Kennedy will be partly  constructed of guns taken out of circulation and melted down, and will be  erected next to Martin Luther King Memorial Park.
Kennedy's widow, Ethel, and his brother Senator Ted Kennedy attended the  ceremony along with two of King's sons and Irish Prime Minister Albert  Reynolds, who was in town to receive an honorary degree from Notre Dame  University.
Clinton and Reynolds met briefly to discuss the latest progress in the  peace effort in Northern Ireland.

The Utah Jazz outlasted the upstart  Denver Nuggets 111-109 in overtime Saturday to take a 3-0 lead in their  best-of-seven National Basketball Association playoffs second-round series.
The Nuggets, the youngest team in the NBA, are now one game away from  elimination in a series no one expected them to reach in the first place, but  it took crucial overtime baskets from Utah's Jeff Hornacek and John Stockton  to give the Jazz the win.
Hornacek had 27 points, Stockton 24 and Karl Malone had 26 points for Utah  as the Jazz won their sixth straight playoff game.
LaPhonso Ellis had led a late surge that let Denver force the overtime,  finishing with 25 points. Dikembe Mutombo had 20 points, 13 rebounds and six  blocked shots for the Nuggets.
The teams were tied 98-98 at the end of regulation time. In overtime they  traded baskets until Hornacek's three-point shot with a minute and a half left  put the Jazz ahead for good.
Denver, who upset Western Conference top seeds Seattle in the first round,  will be fighting to stay alive in game four on Tuesday.
In Indianapolis, the Indiana Pacers took a 2-1 lead over Atlanta with a  101-81 victory.
The Pacers needed just 34 minutes to score their first 69 points of the  game -- matching the record-low total they posted in losing game two in  Atlanta on Thursday.
Rik Smits and Reggie Miller made the difference for the Pacers, Smits  scoring consistently from the inside and Miller from the outside.
"We did a better job of getting (Smits) the ball," said Pacers coach Larry  Brown. "We're trying to figure out ways we can get it to him early before help  gets there."
Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkins said: "We allowed Rik Smits down the block too  many times. You can't let people just take their position, and he did. He got  on the block and that hurt us."
Smits scored 18 of his 27 points in the first half as Indiana took command  early. They led 53-42 at halftime.
Miller added 16 for the Pacers, while Kevin Willis led the Hawks with just  14 points.
Even so, Willis was confident the Hawks could level the series on Tuesday  before heading back to Atlanta.
"I don't think we'll go back down 3-1," he said. "We'll come out with even  greater intensity. We have to move the ball on offense."

Western and Russian diplomats shunned a planned  signing ceremony Saturday for a Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation because they  were angry about extra land being demanded by the two groups, Croatian  newspapers said Sunday.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who presided at a celebration in  Geneva to mark the US-brokered project, said a formal ceremony had been  dropped as superfluous as a document had already been signed in Vienna in  March.
But the Croatian daily Vecernji List said the powers behind a new joint  peace declaration on Bosnia were angry about Croat and Moslem insistance that  the new state cover 58 percent of the old Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The peace plan, endorsed by US, Russian and five west European foreign  ministers in Geneva late Friday, would provide 51 percent of  Bosnia-Hercegovina to a Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to Serbs.
Bosnian land claims "displeased" some ministers present who then "declined  to attend the signing ceremony, which turned into a reception," said Vecernji  List. Most sent diplomats in their place and "Russia was not represented at  all."
The daily Vjesnik, close to the Croatian government, also referred to the  "discontent" shown especially by Russia, Britain and France.
Christopher diplomatically avoided all criticism at Saturday's  celebration, saying its message was that peace could be achieved through  negotiations.
A framework had been established to protecting the political and human  rights of the people who lived in the federation, and "the darkness of  inter-ethnic strife is slowly giving way to a glimmer of reconciliation," he  said.
But Bosnian Moslem leaders criticised the US, European and Russian joint  declaration Saturday, saying it amounted to an endorsement of ethnic cleansing.
The Croat-Moslem land demands came in an agreement signed by the two  groups in Vienna Wednesday, which also gave details of the proposed new  federation's interim government.
The official Croatian news agency HINA, which published the text of the  agreement Saturday, said Moslems would hold the most important posts.
A Croat will hold the interim presidency for the first six months,  followed by a popularly elected candidate. The post of prime minister should  go to a Moslem, it said.
Moslems will also hold the ministries of interior, foreign affairs,  transport, energy and industry, refugees and welfare, education and science,  environment and three ministries without portfolio.
The deputy prime minister, who will also hold the defence ministry, will be  a Croat along with the ministers of finance, justice, trade and health and one  minister without portfolio, it said.
The original agreement signed in Washington in March said the presidency  would rotate between Moslem and Croat candidates holding one-year mandates.

Yemen faces a bleak future with the civil war  set to aggravate its already severe economic difficulties, diplomats said  Saturday.
The civil war broke out at a time when the country was already grappling  with large debt and persistent deficits in its budget and balance of payments,  one diplomat said.
"War in a country already suffering from severe economic problems is a  disaster. It will only sap its limited resources and this will make it unable  to stand again on its feet for a long time," a Gulf-based diplomat said.
Large-scale funds will be needed for post-war reconstruction and although  Yemen produces some oil, there is no sign that oil prices will improve in the  near future.
Yemen produces around 335,000 barrels per day (bpd), including nearly  195,000 bpd from Mareb in the north, but one third of output is consumed  locally.
So far neither side has published official figures for the number of  casualties or damage caused in fighting which broke out between rival north  and south troops on May 5.
But airports in Aden in the south and Saana in the north have been  targeted by air raids and long-range missiles, along with other civilian  buildings.
Diplomats said the war could inflict heavy losses if northern troops  advance on Aden, the economic capital of the unified state.
Since former North and South Yemen were merged in May 1990, Yemeni  authorities have reported a large increase in oil production and reserves due  to major discoveries in both areas.
They pledged to use the oil wealth to finance domestic development and  bring prosperity to one of the world's poorest nations.
But such dreams have not materialised and the economy took a downturn when  Gulf countries suspended their aid following Yemen's perceived backing of the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
Some 700,000 Yemenis, who had constituted a major source of hard currency  for their country, were also expelled from Saudia Arabia during the Gulf  crisis, pushing unemployment up to 36 percent.
There have also been allegations that not all the oil revenues were  finding their way into the state coffers.
A United Nations study has drawn a bleak picture of Yemen's economy saying  debt has reached serious levels, deficits persist, unemployment is rising and  the farming and industrial sector are running low.
The study by the Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA)  estimated Yemen's debt at between seven to nine billion dollars and the budget  deficit at about 800 million dollars in 1993, nearly 83 percent of revenues.
"The Gulf war and its consequences dealt another blow to Yemen, inflicting  losses of more than two billion dollars and causing the return of over 700,000  Yemenis," said the study, published Saturday by the United Arab Emirates  semi-official newspaper al-Ittihad.
"This put another burden on the economy. Unemployment rose and remittances  from expatriates abroad sharply declined, depriving Yemen of one of its main  income sources which had helped it finance imports and development."
With the population projected to grow from 12 million to 16 million in  2000, Yemen needs to boost revenues by up to 16 percent annually to stop a  deterioration in living standards, the report said.
While to improve living standards, revenues needed to grow by between 21.8  and 26 percent annually, it added.
It said the budget deficit had persisted because Yemen had failed to  control spending while excessive banknotes issue sharply boosted prices and  depressed the purchasing power of the national currency, the rial.
Another study by the Arab League showed Yemen's debt servicing exceeded  100 million dollars in 1992 while its balance of payments suffered from a  deficit of 664 million dollars.
A decline in oil prices widened its trade balance gap to 1.59 billion  dollars in 1992 from 1.2 billion dollars in 1991.

About 3.8 million Malawians will elect a new  president and 177 legislators Tuesday to end three decades of one-party and  strongman rule of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
"It will be the big acid test for Banda and his ruling Malawi Congress  Party" (MCP), a Blantyre voter said.
The poll comes nearly one year after a referendum backed the introduction  of multi-party politics in this impoverished southern African nation of 10  million people.
Banda, who is officially 88 but is widely believed to be in his 90s, has  ruled Malawi with an iron hand. He was compelled to call the referendum after  strong internal and international pressure to democratise the country.
He had previously vowed that as long as he lived, no multi-party politics  would be introduced in Malawi.
The elections will consist of separate parliamentary and presidential  polls and the head of state will be elected by popular vote regardless of how  his party will fare.
Banda, haunted by defeat in the referendum, has stiff opposition from  Bakili Muluzi, the popular leader of the United Democratic Front (UDF)  favoured to win the presidential poll.
Muluzi, 51, is Banda's former right-hand man and most of his senior  executives once served the MCP in ministerial positions.
But fears have grown that the fragmented opposition -- which failed to  unite despite enormous public calls for unity -- will share votes on two other  presidential candidates: Chakufwa Chihana, 53, of the Alliance for Democracy  (AFORD) and Kamlepo Kalua, 36, of the Malawi Democratic Party (MDP).
Fifth presidential candidate Tim Mangwazu of the Malawi National  Democratic Party (MNDP) pulled out of the race earlier this month to join a  loose alliance called Common Electoral Group (CEG) with five other parties.
The CEG, mainly backing Muluzi as their presidential candidate, is  composed  of the UDF, the Malawi Democratic Union (MDU), MNDP, the Congress  for Second Republic (CRS) and the United Front for Multi-Party Democracy  (UfMD).
Political analysts here believe that the battle is between the MCP and the  UDF, the only two of the eight parties which fielded candidates for all 177  seats.
The ailing president, who underwent brain surgery last October and  recently cut short an election campaign tour of the country because of an  undisclosed leg ailment, Saturday inspected troops from an open truck as some  20,000 people turned up at a stadium here to celebrate his official birthday.
Another 50,000 attended an opposition rally that was addressed by  presidential challenger Muluzi.
He predicted that his party, with a strong base in the densely-populated  south of the country, would win the elections.
Muluzi said Banda's government had done "nothing" to develop Malawi, while  his party would strive to fulfill its election promises, including free  education.
"There is a lot of poverty in this country. We want to change that and  make Malawi a prosperous nation," he said.
Earlier, Banda said in an address on national radio that his work of  ruling Malawi was not yet finished.
He said he and his Malawi Congress Party had the experience and skills  necessary to face the "challenges and dangers" ahead of the country.
Banda, accused of serious human rights abuses during his rule, said his  government would respect human rights and uphold good and accountable  government.

England's Laura Davies carded a  two-under-par 69 here Saturday to snatch a share of the third-round lead in  the LPGA Championship, level with Meg Mallon on 211.
Davies, the top money-winner on the women's tour this season, jumped from  fourth place to the top of the leaderboard, assisted by Mallon's bogeys at 13  and 15.
Alice Ritzman, seeking her first victory in 402 LPGA Tour tournaments,  missed a chance to join the leaders when she bogeyed the last hole to complete  a 71 for 212.
She was tied with defending champion Patty Sheehan, who posted a one-over  72.
Sweden's Liselotte Neumann carded the best round of the tournament so far,  a 67, to stand tied with Beth Daniel at 214.
Davies birdied three of the last seven holes to put herself in contention  for her third tournament victory of the year.
"Obviously it's nice to get right in there and be tied for the lead," she  said. "Now I know that if I shoot the lowest round tomorrow, I'll win."
Davies said she was striking the ball well, and could have built up a  cushion on the field she had had a bit more luck.
"That's the best I ever hit, on number eight right through 17," she said.  "I played well, and that's the main thing. I've got good thoughts going into  tomorrow."
Neumann's low round was highlighted by a 176-footer for eagle on the  par-four second hole.
"That hole owed me big time," she said. "When I hit that shot, I was  really pumped up."
Ritzman, winless in 17 years on the tour, was delighted with her position,  achieved despite an painful left shoulder.
"Yes, I have a chance to win," she said. "I didn't think I'd be able to  play golf with an injured shoulder, so this is a treat."

A strange first day of Indianapolis  500 time trials ended with a rookie on the front row, a woman in the second  and a top pole contender waiting to drive.
Al Unser Jnr won a provisional pole for the May 29 race in time trials  here Saturday, but reigning champion and practice speed leader Emerson  Fittipaldi can still topple his Penske teammate.
"I'm not really anxious or nervous, but I think it will be very difficult  to beat Al Jnr," Fittipaldi said. "The waiting game is tough, though. I hope  weather conditions are the same."
Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve qualified third. The son of late  Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve could be the first front-row rookie at  Indy since Italy's Teo Fabi took the 1983 pole.
Lyn St. James, Indy's lone female driver, made a stunning fifth-place  showing, edging England's Nigel Mansell in the starting grid.
"I'm sure Nigel will get razzed, but he's got a good sense of humor," St.  James said.
A total of 21 drivers, seven of them rookies, qualified with an average  speed of 222.999 mph (356.798 km/h), but the rain-shortened session ended with  Fittipaldi last on a list of nine others waiting to take the 2.5-mile (4km)  oval. Each has one chance for the pole when qualifying continues Sunday.
"I don't mind having him go through that wait," said Unser, who has never  made a front-row start in 11 Indy races. He and Fittipaldi both use the  Mercedes engine that has dominated practice.
Unser, whose father won the pole here 24 years ago, improved with each lap  to reach a four-lap qualifying average of 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h). The  effort came despite hitting a bird on his first lap.
"I ran into it in turn one and it scared the heck out of me," Unser said.  "It shouldn't bother me. But I wanted to check out the car and make sure  everything was working all right."
---
His first lap was 225.722 mph (361.115 km/h), but his next three laps were  the day's fastest, peaking at 229.481 mph (367.169 km/h).
"That's the sign of a great race car," Unser said. "When I saw 225, I knew  I needed to get after it more than that."
Roberto Guerrero's 1992 Indy qualifying record of 232.482 mph (371.971  k/hr) was never threatened.
Brazil's Raul Boesel qualified second at 227.618 mph (364.188 km/h),  putting aside the disappointment of penalties that cost him a victory here  last year.
"We've worked hard to come back," Boesel said. "I'm looking forward, not  behind. I thought we had a shot at the pole. The car was close to perfect. We  accomplished what we set out to do."
Villeneuve became the fastest Indy rookie ever, qualifying at 226.259 mph  ((362.014 km/h) to complete the provisional front row.
"It feels great," he said. "I was flat out from the beginning."
The second row so far includes former Formula One driver Michael Andretti,  St. James and reigning Indy series champion Mansell. The British racer's run  of 224.041 mph (358.465 km/h) came just before a three-hour rain delay.
"The car was running slower," Mansell said. "As the front came in, there  was more humidity in the air and it slowed us down a bit. The wind was  swirling and I had a hard time down the straights. I'm just happy we got the  run in and we can concentrate on the race."
St. James was celebrating a starting spot nine places better than any  woman at Indy.
"It feels geat to be where I'm at," she said. "From here, anything's  possible."
Penske racer Paul Tracy, injured in a practice crash Friday, was released  from Methodist Hospital but not cleared to drive Saturday, ending his pole  bid.

The center-left Party of Brazilian Social  Democracy on Saturday named Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso its candidate  for the October presidential elections.
Cardoso, a former treasury secretary, is the closest rival to frontrunner  Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva of the leftist Workers' Party, according to a  recent poll. Seventeen percent of those surveyed said they would vote for him,  compared with 41 percent for "Lula."
Senator Guilherme Palmeira, of the northeastern state of Alagoas, was  named his running mate for vice president.
Cardoso, in unveiling his party's government plan, said lowering Brazil's  chronic inflation inflation and stabilizing the economy would take between two  and three years.
The party narrowly voted to form an alliance with the rightwing Liberal  Front Party and the Brazilian Workers' Party.
The current president, Itamar Franco, is constitutionally barred from  seeking a consecutive term of office in the October 3 vote.

A Chicago man who does not think executing serial  killer John Wayne Gacy sent enough of a message has spent about 20,000 dollars  on the murderer's paintings simply in order to burn them.
"We want them wiped off the map," said Joe Roth, a businessman who bought  more than two dozen of the 40 paintings auctioned off shortly before Tuesday's  execution.
Gacy, who was executed by lethal injection, was convicted in 1980 of  murdering 33 boys and young men during the 1970s.
Roth, 50, said the execution and the media coverage did not send a strong  enough message to warn parents to watch their children to prevent another Gacy  from striking again.
Roth said he would torch the works, depicting subjects ranging from Mickey  Mouse to Jesus, within 30 days.
He said he was disappointed he could not buy Gacy's entire oeuvre. "It's  too bad we couldn't have wiped them all off the map."
Others among the 200 people at the auction got there first, some of them  paying as much as 800 dollars for a painting, auction organizers said.
Some of the auction's proceeds will go to the families of Gacy's victims.

Three Australian drag queens caused a  sensation here late Saturday in the premiere of a film which brought immediate  comparisons to the surprise 1992 sensation "Strictly Ballroom."
The five-minute standing ovation accorded to the late-night screening of  "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" far exceeded that of any  other movie so far screened at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival.
"It's just like "Ballroom," said one Cannes regular, referring to the  Australian movie, also premiered here in a midnight screening, also in the Un  Certain Regard section of the festival, two years ago.
"Priscilla" -- a musical, like "Ballroom," which went on to be a massive  international hit -- tells the story of three drag queens travelling by bus  from Sydney to Alice Springs.
Along the way they bring the music of the likes of Gloria Gaynor, Village  People, and especially Abba, to various sets of aborigines and small town  hicks -- with varying reactions.
At the end of Saturday night's premiere the Theatre Claude Debussy in the  famous Festival Palace was still rocking to the strains of Abba's "Mamma Mia."
The premiere of the film, starring Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy  Pearce, was attended by director Stephan Elliott and various other members of  the crew.
Elliott, whose first film "Fraud" appeared in competition here last year,  was not immediately available for comment, as he was swallowed up in the  late-night Croisette crowd.

A tornado and thunderstorms stopped play in  the second round of the Byron Nelson Classic Saturday afternoon as organizers  struggled to get the weather-disrupted event back on track.
Ben Crenshaw, David Ogrin, Mark Carnevale and Brad Bryant were all at  eight-under-par when play was abandoned for the day.
Only six players in the 156-strong field completed two rounds on Saturday  -- the goal of organizers after play was completely washed out on both  Thursday and Friday.
Three golfers pulled out of the event and 147 marked their balls on the  two courses being used. They were to return Sunday morning as tournament  officials tried to get through 54 holes by Sunday evening.
Local police said a tornado touched down on the Cottonwood Valley golf  course, jumped over the tournament press center and dissipated on Saturday  afternoon.
Cottonwood Valley, located across the street from the Tournament Players  Club at Las Colinas, was called into use for Saturday's double round.
Ogrin led after the first round with a 64 on the par 71 Cottonwood layout,  where Mark Carnevale shot a 65.
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, Nick Price of Zimbabwe and Tommy Armour all  shot 65, but they were on the par-70 Las Colinas course, so they were two  behind in relation to par.
Crenshaw shot a first-round 66 at Las Colinas and was four-under for the  second round at Cottonwood with four to play when the storms halted the second  round.
Bryant, also had four to play at Cottonwood, while Ogrin had three left at  Las Colinas and Carnevale had five.
"It's a shame," Crenshaw said of the afternoon disruption. "If you're  scheduled to play 36 holes in a day you want to go ahead and play 36 holes.
"Nobody likes to start and stop. That's tournament golf."

Prince Charles is to start a historic three-day  visit to the old imperial Russian capital Saint Petersburg Monday, the first  royal British appearance there in a century.
He is going for practical reasons -- the heir to the British throne is  leading a delegation of his Business Leaders' Forum, launched 10 years ago to  support private entreprise, which is providing assistance to the city.
But the visit also has great symbolic importance, as Prince Charles will  visit the tombs of the Romanov imperial family, who were related by blood to  the British royal family.
In a message before his departure, Prince Charles said the "political and  social map of Europe and the former Soviet Union has changed dramatically  (and) that transformation is continuing at a pace few could have foreseen."
"All of us have an immense interest in making sure that new-found freedom  and market economies are able to grow on a sound and sustainable basis," he  said.
All the Romanov tsars are buried in Saint Petersburg except for the last,  Nicholas II, who was murdered along with his family by the Bolsheviks in  Yekaterinburg in 1918.
The remains of the tsar, his wife and three daughters were discovered  three years ago in a forest near the town and formally identified in London  last July, but the Russian government has not yet decided where to bury them.
Nicholas II was the cousin of King George V, the grandfather of the  Prince's mother Queen Elizabeth II. His wife Alexandra was the sister of the  grandmother of the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Elizabeth's husband Prince Philip.
Their marriage in 1894 was the occasion for the last British royal visit  to the city, then capital of the Russian empire.
British royalty conducted an unofficial boycott of Russia after the  Romanov assassination, broken only in 1973 when Prince Philip went to Moscow  as president of the International Equestrian Federation.
He was followed by his youngest son Prince Edward and his daughter,  Princess Anne, in 1990.
After Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth herself is due to visit Russia  before the end of the year after being invited by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin.
The Prince has been preceded by experts from his Business Leaders' Forum,  who are advising Saint Petersburg on ways to develop tourism and preserve its  cultural heritage.
The Forum is also financing the first-ever publication of the complete  notebooks of the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin. During his visit the Prince  of Wales is to sign a final agreement to publish 800 copies of the notebooks  in eight volumes in a 750,000-dollar project.
The Prince is also due to pay tribute to the many victims of World War II  at the city's vast cemetery and visit a hospital which the Forum has helped to  modernise.

Uzbek President Islam Karimov is to make an  official four-day visit Monday to what he has described as the "incredible,  fairytale land" of Japan, to drum up investment for his struggling central  Asian country.
Business ties between the two countries are very weak, with trade last  year reaching 30 million dollars. This consisted mainly of Uzbek cotton and  gas exports and Japanese imports of high-tech goods such as computers.
Japan could "offer development aid and loans soon" but there has been no  time since the invitation was made late April to draw up any formal  agreements, said Japan's charge d'affaires in Tashkent, Kodzi Hino.
"I cannot say if Uzbekistan is a promising market. Taxes on foreign  businesses are not going in the right direction. None of the joint entreprises  set up to date are really functioning, they only exist on paper," said the  diplomat.
But since relations with Russia are still hampered by territorial  disputes, Japan "cannot neglect central Asia," he added.
Karimov's visit will allow him to "see how the Japanese work" and admire  Uzbek antiquities, brought to Japan 2,000 years ago along the old Silk Route.
Unlike neighbouring Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan has not yet signed an agreement  with the International Monetary Fund which insists on tougher spending and  monetary controls.
A weak currency in the former Soviet republic means that most trade is  carried out as barter and people have little spending power.
Japan does not object, however, to Karimov's authoritarian style which  forbids political opposition.
"Political stability is the most important thing," said Hino.
"If the economic crisis gets worse, (Islamic) fundamentalism will become a  threat here. Most opposition parties are religious and we don't like that."

Vietnam is planning to spend 1.8 billion dollars to  upgrade Ho Chi Minh City's airport into one of the largest in the region,  capable of handling 50 million passengers a year, a report said Sunday.
Teams from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Department have  completed a feasibility study into plans for Tan Son Nhat airport, once the  busiest in Southeast Asia when it served as the main airbase for US forces in  Vietnam before 1975, the Vietnam Investment Review said.
Some 400 million dollars are to be spent in the next three years to build  a new international terminal capable of handling eight million passengers a  year, the newspaper of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment  said.
Passenger traffic trebled between 1990 and 1993, with 24 international and  domestic airlines now using the airport.
Some 1.6 million passengers passed through Tan Son Nhat last year and the  figure is expected to grow to eight million by 2000, the newspaper said. If  the plan is completed by 2010, the airport will be capable of handling between  40 million and 50 million passengers a year.
Currently the airport only handles around 30,000 tonnes of cargo a year,  but new facilities will increase capacity 10-fold and will allow 46 large  cargo jets to use the terminal at any one time.
The airport, located a short distance from the centre of Ho Chi Minh City,  currently handles around 50 flights a day but facilities are limited and  overstretched.
Many travellers have also complained about widespread corruption and  bureaucratic problems at the airport, the main gateway into Vietnam.

Queen Beatrix formally has appointed three party  officials to negotiate a broad coalition government for the Netherlands,  thrown into political turmoil after this month's general election.
The negotiators will be Klaus de Vries for the Social Democrats (PVDA),  Gijs van Aardenne for the right-wing Liberal Democrats (VVD) and Jan Vis for  the left-wing Democrats '66 (D66).
Receiving the three at the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague late Saturday,  the Queen asked them to "explore in as short a period possible the  possibilities of forming a cabinet" from the three groups.
De Vries has been director general of the federation of Dutch local  councils since 1988. A lawyer who has worked in the justice ministry, he was a  member of parliament from 1973 to 1988.
Van Aardenne is a former minister of the economy, who was also deputy  prime minister in the first cabinet of Ruud Lubbers from 1982 to 1986.
Vis has chaired the D66 parliamentary group in the Senate, of which he has  been a member since 1980. A former journalist, he teaches constitutional law  at the university of Groningen.
If the negotiators manage to reconcile the differences between their  parties they will present a final report to the Queen, who will then decide  who should be asked to form a government and become the country's next prime  minister.
The left-right coalition, if it comes off, will be the first time the  Christian Democrats (CDA), have been left out of power for 75 years.
But analysts said that despite the goodwill expressed on all sides, it  would not be easy to set up a left-right coalition because of wide differences  over certain issues, notably social security.
If talks break down, the outgoing coalition could return with the addition  of the D66 Liberals, or the Christian Democrats could make an alliance with  the VVD and D66.
The Christian Democrats lost 20 seats in the vote on May 3, retaining only  34 in the 150-seat lower house of parliament.
Their partners in the last government, the Social Democrats, lost 12 seats  but became the biggest parliamentary party with 37 seats. The VVD gained nine  seats, putting their tally to 31, while D66 doubled its score to 24 seats.

An Arab League delegation visiting Yemen to mediate  between the warring north and south was finally received by President Ali  Abdallah Saleh's office, radio Sanaa announced late Saturday in a report  monitored by the BBC.
The delegation had been waiting since Thursday to deliver a call by the  League's General Secretary Esmat Abdel Meguid for an immediate ceasefire and  return to talks to "safeguard unity" of the country, the radio said.
But although southern organisations in Aden have called on the Arab League  to step in to end the fighting, so far northern leaders have rejected any  foreign intervention in the 10-day-old civil war which they consider an  "internal matter."
The conservative North and formerly communist South Yemen states united in  May 1990 after long and delicate negotiations.
The League was received by Abdel Aziz Abdel Ghani, member of the  collective presidency, who said northern leaders would back a ceasefire if  "war criminal" Ali Salem al-Baid surrendered in the south and if the  constitutional legitimacy of Saleh's government was recognised.
Baid, the Yemenite vice president, was stripped of his functions in the  first days of the fighting.
It was not yet known if the Arab League delegation would continue to the  southern economic capital Aden. Earlier, the League had said at its Cairo  headquarters that a visit would depend on the results of its Sanaa talks.
Last week an emergency meeting of the League turned down an Egyptian  proposal to send an Arab peacekeeping force to Yemen and it has ruled out any  early Arab summit to discuss the crisis.
In Aden, Baid's Yemen Socialist Party repeated calls for a ceasefire  Saturday, "out of a profound desire to avoid a destructive war" which it said  could threaten the country's new-found unity.
The war could not be confined to a small part of Yemen, and "its flames  will spread to include all towns, shores, mountains and valleys of the  homeland without exception," the party said in a statement broadcast on Aden  radio.
The fighting went on because the "bloodthirsty gang" in Sanaa "continues to  ignore all those appeals and initiatives and boasts about its determination to  march over a river of blood and over the skulls of its victims," continued the  statement, monitored by the BBC.
In the Saudi capital Riyadh Saturday, the dismissed southern oil minister  Saleh Abou Bakr Ben Husseinoun came to stressing the south's desire to return  to peace talks and maintain a reconciliation accord signed between the two  sides in February in Amman.
Northern leaders have already rejected a five-point appeal from the south,  issued Friday, which called for an immediate ceasefire and establishment of a  government of national salvation.
Thousands of people demonstrated in Aden Saturday calling for an immediate  end to the fighting, an AFP correspondent reported. Many brandished photos of  Baid and shouted anti-Saleh slogans.
Local and foreign journalists taken to the strategic town of Daleh, which  lies 90 kilometres (55 miles) from Aden, confirmed that it was held by  northern troops.
Southern forces defending the strategic heights around Daleh had been  pushed back about 10 kilometres (six miles) by attacking northern forces  Saturday and taken up positions at the mountain town of Markula, an AFP  correspondent said.
Radio Sanaa has also claimed that its forces were advancing towards the  main southern airbase of Al Anad and Al Dali and had taken Al Musaymir, only  30 kilometres (18 miles) from the Al Anad air base.
But Radio Aden, monitored by the BBC Saturday evening, denied the reports,  quoting the southern defence minister as denouncing the "misinformation" and  saying the reports were "without foundation."
Journalists said tank and artillery reinforcements had been deployed in  the Al Musaymir area to bolster the north's forces. Hundreds of civilians have  meanwhile fled the fighting for the safety of Aden.
A human rights group based in Sanaa accused southern forces of enlisting  youths to fight against the north, according to a report carried by the  official northern agency SABA.
The group said 147 youths aged 11 to 16 were "trained at the Basahib camp  and joined the war," violating international rules protecting children and a  Yemenite law on military service, which fixes 18 as the minimum age.

Labour leaders, supported by academics and some  politicians here, say Hong Kong workers are being made to pay the price for  economic integration with China even ahead of the 1997 changeover of  sovereignty.
They say moves to increase the number of mainland Chinese working in the  territory will increase unemployment and, inevitably, drive down wages.
Concerns in labour circles have been heightened by the Hong Kong  Government's recent announcement of a programme to import 1,000 recent  graduates from China to work as management trainees.
The government said it is a pilot programme, and, having met an  overwhelming response from employers here, there is already talk of expanding  it.
But the general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions  said the programme should be stopped in the name of fairness. "It will be  disastrous to the workforce of 2.7 million people in Hong Kong," said Lee  Cheuk-yan.
Lee said "workers in Hong Kong have not really enjoyed the prosperity" of  the territory in recent years, with wages barely keeping up with inflation  despite average annual economic growth in the range of five to six percent.
The hundreds of thousands of factory jobs lost in Hong Kong as most of the  territory's industry relocated in low-wage southern China over the last decade  has exerted a downward pressure on the wages of many, said Lee, although  unemployment is officially pegged at only two percent.
Moreover, there have been about 23,000 mainland Chinese labourers working  in Hong Kong for the past two years on temporary permits, and some 10,000  employees of Chinese-owned firms here on special visas.
But Lee said the new labour importation programme was qualitatively  different as it meant competition, for the first time, not for relatively  poorly-paid labouring jobs but for the white collar positions the colony's  young people aspire to.
Saying the programme would "exploit the local workforce," Legislator Lau  Chin-shek, of the pro-democracy United Democrats of Hong Kong party, has led  opposition to the programme, calling it an attempt by the government to try  "to shift responsiblity for the high inflation rate to employees."
As foreign contract labourers are usually paid less than the prevailing  local rate, Lau said, "so mainland professionals will be too."
Ng Shek-hong, a management studies lecturer at the University of Hong  Kong, agreed, saying the programme could dissuade many Hong Kong  undergraduates from taking up business administration courses.
But the government and its business supporters argue that with Hong Kong  and the mainland essentially one economic unit even ahead of China's takeover  in three years, an increased labour flow should be encouraged.
The government's position is that the labour importation programme would  not hurt Hong Kong workers and would ultimately spur more economic and  employment growth here.
The programme, said City Polytechnic social sciences department head  Joseph Cheng, "is a natural development, due to economic complements between  Hong Kong and China."
But Lee said that based on the record so far of China's growing economic  role in Hong Kong -- it is the biggest property investor here, a major player  on the stock market and controls some 1,000 companies -- local workers cannot  expect much benefit.
Chinese firms are largely staffed with mainlanders -- often the children  or other relatives of top communist party officials such as supreme leader  Deng Xiaoping, and "even bring in their own security guards, said Lee.
Also worried by Hong Kong's increasingly close ties to China's labour  market are tens of thousands of unskilled foreign workers; the 113,000  Filipinos in the territory, many of them domestics, make up the largest group  of expatriates.
British concerns over security have limited the number of mainlanders  coming to Hong Kong, but with the Union Jack due to come down in three years  the Filipinos and other foreign labourers fear many of their jobs will be lost  to Cantonese-speaking workers eager to take jobs even at lower wages.

When China's first stock markets opened for  business in Shanghai and Shenzhen three years ago or so, it was a case of too  much money chasing too few stocks. Now, it's the other way around.
With interest rates and inflation tracking upwards, turnover on China's  fledgling bourses has been meager at best this year, and Hong Kong analysts  see slim prospects for real recovery in the coming months.
What could woo investors back into the markets, the analysts add, would be  for more high-capitalization, top-quality stocks to be listed -- instead of a  bevy of small companies whose financial health is shrouded in mystery.
"It's a tight time in the market right now in China," said Brian Power,  managing director of China Securities Research Centre Ltd., which publishes an  independent newsletter on China's emerging markets.
"There are a lot of problems in the Chinese economy, and that makes  Chinese investors pretty nervous -- and foreign ones as well," he said.
So-called B-shares -- denominated in US or Hong Kong dollars and intended  for foreign investors, although also widely held by Chinese nationals -- have  lost a third of their value since the start of the year.
On Friday, the Credit Lyonnais China B Index, put out by Credit Lyonnais  Securities (Asia) Ltd., a Hong Kong unit of the French banking group, finished  at 975.99 after drifting sideways for several sessions.
Turnover has been thin -- in Shanghai on Friday, only 3.5 million US  dollars' worth of B-shares changed hands -- as foreign investors look  elsewhere for greener pastures and Chinese turn to treasury bonds paying 12-15  percent and bank accounts yielding 10.8 percent a year.
That's the reverse of how it was in late 1990 when pent-up demand for  stocks spelled overnight success for communist China's first bona-fide stock  market in Shanghai, followed by a second in Shenzhen, abutting Hong Kong, in  July 1991.
Both the B-share and more speculative A-share market, reserved for domestic  investors, have stabilized in recent days, apparently on buying by Chinese  government agencies trying to avert a wholesale crash.
"We've seen some buying, but we don't know by who -- maybe the (central)  People's Bank," said C.Y. Ho, head of China research at Credit Lyonnais  Securities. "Certainly it was not genuine institutional buying."
Longer term, a major stock rally looks unlikely as inflation -- now  running officially at 23.2 percent -- stays high and the government jacks up  interest rates to keep annual growth at no more than nine percent.
"Especially in Shanghai, it appears that B-shares have found strong  support at the current levels" after their recent fall, said Jacky Chiu, head  of China research at Nomura Research Institute (Hong Kong) Ltd.
They might ever perform better later this year, but that presumes there  will be no worsening of the Chinese economy, Chiu said.
Nevertheless, Beijing still counts on foreigners to snap up whatever new  B-share issue it approves -- and there will be at least 50 this year alone,  according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency on Thursday.
Currently there are 28 B-shares lists in Shanghai and 21 in Shenzhen.
"The present B-share market is too small to meet the enterprise demand for  foreign fund supply," Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  Commission, told a business gathering in Beijing.
But Hong Kong analysts say China should look more closely at what the  market really wants -- and that's better quality stocks from bigger state-run  companies, like railways and auto plants.
"Beijing should encourage more best-quality, larger market capitalization,  more liquid companies to be listed," Credit Lyonnais' Ho said. "Now they're  doing the opposite... They prefer more companies with a smaller issue size."
"From the Chinese point of view, they need a lot of money for enterprise  reform," Nomura's Chiu added. "But investors are not that optimistic about  Chinese economic development, at least in the short term... You have to  consider the market and whether it can absorb all these new issues."

Tiana Thanh Nga, an American film-maker from  Vietnam, has come to preview her autobiographical film "From Hollywood to  Hanoi," -- a vibrant but controversial plea for reconciliation among all  Vietnamese.
Her documentary was shown Friday in Hanoi before a very select audience,  including film-makers, cultural ministry officials and famous figures such as  General Vo Nguyen Giap and former foreign minister Nguyen Co Thach.
The film expresses the feelings and follows the daily lives of "Viet Kieu"  (Vietnamese expatriates) living in the United States who fled their native  country after the communist victory in 1975, but also their compatriots who  stayed behind.
The story evolves from the personal recollections of Tiana Thanh Nga, who  has become a popular actress in Kung Fu films and is a rock singer in the  United States. She comes from an elite family in Saigon that was staunchly  anti-communist and emigrated to America in 1966. Her uncle was defence  minister in the former South Vietnamese government.
Filmed over the last six years, "From Hollywood to Hanoi" was produced by  Oliver Stone, director of such films as "Platoon," "Born on the Fourth of  July" and "Between Heaven and Earth," a trilogy on the Vietnam War.
Tiana, 33, said she was "sad to not have received the support of her  family and the Vietnamese in the United States who did not understand my  intentions."
"They were blinded by their resentment, and they have accused the  communists of having provoked all of this," she said in Hanoi.
"There is too much misunderstanding and despair for those we want to  help," she said, referring to the "hard core" of the about two million "Viet  Kieu" who refuse reconciliation.
At the Hanoi screening, Vietnamese cultural ministry officials said they  supported the film's "positive subject" and appreciated Tiana's "good will."  But they expressed some reservations about showing the film throughout Vietnam  and appeared offended by scenes showing the massacring of dogs, a popular meat  among Vietnamese.
There were also scenes of Vietnamese obsessed with marrying Americans, as  well as scenes showing chronic depression during the dark years before  Vietnam's economic opening.
"Some scenes should be adjusted to conform to the psychology of the  Vietnamese," said the vice-minister of culture, Vu Khac Lien, who expects a  "meticulous debate" before the film is released to the general public. The  cultural minister is in charge of censorship.
Nguyen Co Thach, a former Vietnamese foreign minister who supports  distributing the film throughout the country, said: "It's a film that helps  reconciliation. But this will be difficult because it shows "Viet Kieu" who  retain violently anti-communist positions."
General Giap said it "was difficult to make a film that was applauded in  both Vietnam and the United States."
Tiana has asked for authorization to show the film here, which she  financed by selling all of her belongings.
"What good would would it do if (her film) remains in the dark," she asked.
If everything goes well, the film will be shown November and December in  Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City, according to an official from the  Commission for Vietnamese Overseas.
Tiana is also making a four-hour documentary titled "The War is Over, A  New Vietnam," scheduled to be released April 30, 1995, for the 20th  anniversary of the fall of Saigon.

A two-day orgy of anti-Tibetan violence  has shattered the tranquility of this northern Indian town, where the Tibetan  spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, has lived in exile for nearly 35 years.
Tibetan homes, shops, schools and monasteries still bear the scars of last  month's rampage by scores of Indian youths enraged by the death of a local boy  in a knife fight with a Tibetan.
Glass-fitters have begun the painstaking task of replacing the thousands  of window panes smashed by the angry mobs, but restoring confidence between  Tibetans and their Indian neighbors is likely to take even longer.
"Fear and suspicion still prevail," said Tenzing Sangpo, principal of the  Tibetan Children's Village School, which was targetted by the rioters. "There   is an atmosphere of uncertainty."
Sangpo, who helped douse fires set inside the school serving nearly 700  students between the ages of five and 16, described the attacks as a "total  shock." "Our relations had been healthy," he said.
Dawa Tsering, 40, chief welfare officer for the Tibetan community here,  said many Tibetans had been traumatised.
"I don't think this will happen again, but there is still some fear among  the people," he said. "Many want to leave, and if the Dalai Lama shifts, then  everybody, or at least 99 percent of the Tibetans here, will also go."
Distressed by the violence, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate last week  raised the possibility of moving to another city in India, now home to more  than 100,000 Tibetan refugees, if Tibetans were no longer wanted here.
The Dalai Lama established his headquarters in Dharamsala, nestled in the  foothills of the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh state, in 1960, a year after  fleeing Tibet following an abortive anti-Chinese uprising.
Between 6,000 and 8,000 Tibetans live in Dharamsala and it houses the  headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile as well as hospitals,  monasteries, a library and Tibetan handicrafts and medicine factories.
Tibetan government-in-exile officials here told AFP that the Dalai Lama has  decided to stay put for the moment but has sought "concrete assurances" from  the state authorities that Tibetans would not be victimised again.
Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh urged the Dalai Lama  during two meetings last week to remain in Dharamsala and pledged to improve  security.
Tibetans and Indians said the April 22 stabbing of the local teenager by a  Tibetan provided the spark for years of simmering resentment among some local  Indians over the relative prosperity of the Tibetans to flare into violence.
Dozens of stone-throwing Indian youths attacked Tibetan property the night  of the murder of the local boy and the trouble erupted anew after his  cremation the next day.
Witnesses said Kishan Kapoor, a member of the state assembly from the  Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party who has demanded that Tibetans leave  Himachal Pradesh, delivered an inflammatory speech at the funeral which sent  mourners on the rampage again.
Tibetans here charged that local police watched the mayhem, in which a  dozen Tibetans were injured, and only moved in when the mobs began looting.
Jagdish Chander, the local magistrate, said Indians here had a number of  grievances against the Tibetans, mainly that there are too many of them, that  they are building on their land and that raw sewage drains into their fields.
"The local people also say that the Tibetans don't allow them to reap the  benefits of tourism," said Chander, referring to the thousands of foreigners  who flock here every year to study or have an audience with the Dalai Lama.
Dawa Tsering, the Tibetan welfare officer, said that although Tibetans  have built schools and sanitation facilities for the local Indian community,  it was obvious they would have to do more to restore communal harmony.
Tempa Tsering, an official Tibetan spokesman, said the violence did not  reflect the views of most Indians living in Dharamsala.
"It's regrettable that a quarrel between two individuals led to a problem  between two communities," he said. "The grievances of local people are there  but they are being highlighted and exploited by local politicians for votes."

Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City are to tighten rules  on foreigners registering with the police as part of a clampdown on foreign  residents in the southern city, according to a report seen here Sunday.
All foreigners, including overseas Vietnamese, with have to register with  the immigration authorities and police, and hotel owners will be responsible  for reporting all guests, the Saigon Giai Phong newspaper said in its Saturday  edition.
The clampdown follows demands by the powerful interior ministry to tighten  control over foreigners in the city, Vietnam's economic centre that has seen a  large rise in residents from overseas in recent years.
The southern city, formerly Saigon, has taken a more relaxed attitude than  other towns towards its foreign residents, many of whom have not previously  registered with the police.
The move is likely to prove unpopular with the city's business community,  that frequently complains about corruption and excessive bureaucracy.
Residents of other cities in Vietnam are required to register themselves  and any guests but the rules are often applied in an arbitrary fashion.

Beijing warned Washington Sunday that it could not  afford to overlook China's global importance by maintaining its "out of date"  policy of attaching conditions to renewal of preferential trade terms.
Just weeks before the deadline for US President Bill Clinton to decide  whether to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) status, foreign trade  ministry official Zhou Shijian emphasised how much withdrawal would cost  Washington in both economic and geopolitical terms.
"The US cannot ignore the fact that China has one-fifth of the world's  population and has its own nuclear power, that China is a permanent member of  the UN Security Council and is an important element for stability in the  Asia-Pacific region," the China Daily Business weekly quoted Zhou as saying.
When he extended MFN last year, Clinton warned he would not do so again in  1994 unless China made significant progress in human rights.
China, which has consistently condemned the linkage of trade and human  rights, has sent mixed signals to the United States in recent months --  releasing some prominent dissidents while arresting others.
However, Beijing has failed to take any significant steps to improve the  overall human rights situation in China, appearing confident that Washington  would not dare carry through its threat to withdraw MFN.
"Isn't it out of date for the US administration to be simmering with  debate over whether or under what conditions to continue MFN trade status for  China, while most western countries are helping their businesses to enter the  Chinese market?" Zhou was quoted as saying.
Emphasising that China planned to import one trillion dollars worth of  goods before 2000, he said the United States could not ignore this "vast  market" if it wished to keep its own economy going.
"We should be clearly aware of the fact that despite all the major or  minor skirmishes in the past, bilateral trade has developed in the fast lane,"  Zhou  said, pointing to a 176 percent rise between 1988 and 1933.
The China Daily said actual US investment in China was expected to hit nine  billion dollars this year, adding that a recent Chinese trade delegation to  the United States had clinched investment and export agreements worth more  than 13.5 billion dollars.
"The exceptional growth momentum proves that the mutually beneficial  nature of the two countries' economies is not subject to changes by wishful  thinking," said Zhou.

China said Sunday its new foreign trade law had  established a transparent and uniform national system in line with the two  basic demands of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
In addition to standardising policy, the long-awaited law, which was  passed last week, requires that any management of foreign trade be carried out  in line with rules set by GATT, which China is seeking to rejoin, the China  Daily Business Weekly reported.
Any restrictions on imports and exports of commodities and technology must  conform with GATT rules, while protection of domestic industries must be  achieved through measures like anti-dumping and anti-subsidy safeguards rather  than import substitution or administrative approval, it said.
The law also stipulates that all foreign trade enterprises be weaned off  subsidies and be responsible for profits and losses.
"With the law, a uniform, fair and free trade policy has taken shape in  China," Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi was quoted  as saying.
China, which was a founding member of GATT but withdrew after the  communists came to power in 1949, is seeking to rejoin the body before it is  replaced by the World Trade Organisation on January 1, 1994.
GATT chief Peter Sutherland said here last week that China's time-frame  was "extremely demanding," pointing to continuing doubts over the transparency  of its foreign trade regime, especially its policies on import quotas,  licences and standards.
The new law stipulates that China can restrict imports to balance trade,  while also containing provisions to protect the service sector from free  competition, the China Daily said.
The sector would only be opened to foreigners on a gradual and conditioned  basis, it said.
The authorities will also continue to license foreign trade enterprises to  prevent the sale of substandard products overseas at unreasonably low prices  and the repeated import of the same product.
"If the licencing system is abandoned, China's foreign trade would be in a  mess," said Wu.

The French Coflexip Group is to build a  55-million dollar (40 million US) production plant at Fremantle near here to  supply the international oil and gas industry, the government announced Sunday.
Under a deal signed in Paris by West Australian state premier Richard  Court and Coflexip directors, an 8.5-million dollar government assistance  package will be provided for the plant.
It will manufacture advanced flexible pipelines, mainly for undersea use.
Court, currently visiting Europe, said in a statement released here the  project would bring 200 new jobs to Fremantle and assist Government efforts to  establish Western Australia as a major regional centre for the international  oil and gas industry.
"Over the next 10 years, billions of dollars will be spent developing  off-shore petroleum fields below the North West Shelf, Timor Sea, Indo-Malay  Archipelago, and the South China Sea," Court said.
"For Coflexip to decide to establish its manufacturing centre in Western  Australia will be recognition of the part the state will be playing in the  development."
The state's growing expertise on the North West Shelf oil and gas field  meant it was ideally placed to help manage, service and supply the industry.
Court said the government had been working to encourage companies like  Coflexip to establish their Asian regional headquarters in Perth.
The Coflexip board is due to meet next month to give final approval for  the plant, which should be ready for full production by July next year, the  statement said.

The nominal leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge  guerrillas, Khieu Samphan, called Sunday for nation-wide resistance to  proposals that western nations should arm Phnom Penh government forces.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio carried an appeal  by Khieu Samphan for "all Khmer residents in rural areas, towns and provinces  as well as abroad ... to defeat the western (arms) plan."
The United States and Australia have said they were considering new  military aid for Cambodia following a plea by King Norodom Sihanouk to save  his country "from the yoke of the Khmer Rouge."
Australian officials said Friday that Canberra, Washington, Paris and some  Asian countries were discussing how to bolster Phnom Penh's ill-disciplined  and poorly-equipped military but no decision had as yet been reached.
Urging all Cambodians "to stand up and undertake whatever action is  required to vanquish the (western) plan," Khieu Samphan said the United States  was the "ring-leader" and that France, Australia and Japan were also involved.
These countries "want to destroy (the Khmer Rouge) and to keep Cambodia  under their influence," he said, asserting that the West was acting now that  Phnom Penh's forces had been virtually defeated.
He noted that the neighboring countries of Southeast Asia were opposed to  any action by the West to arm Phnom Penh troops.
Thai officials notably have urged against new military aid, saying that a  political solution to the continuing Cambodian conflict was preferable.
In Bangkok, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called for a unified stand by  members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) against foreign  interference in Cambodia.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand.

China will overtake Japan to become the world's  biggest steel producer this year, but out-dated technology and poor efficiency  will prevent the country becoming a "steel power," a report said Sunday.
Annual output is forecast to jump 5.7 percent over 1993 to 93 million  tonnes, enabling China to achieve a target set in the early days of the  communist rule, the China Daily Business Weekly said.
Japan's annual output is expected to drop to between 90 and 92 million  tonnes, it said, adding that China's production in the first quarter hit 22.94  million tonnes compared with 22.48 million tonnes in Japan.
"China will surely become the world's largest steel producer this year and  will keep that status in coming years," Vice Minister of the Metallurgical  Industry Zhou Chuandian said, forecasting that output would hit 160 million  tons by 2000.
Last year, China displaced the United States from its position as the  second biggest steel producer.
Despite the successes in boosting output, more than half the 100 steel  products urgently needed in China are in short supply, said Zhou, urging a  shift in policy from quantity to catching up with competitors in terms of  variety and quality.
A low continuous-casting capacity -- accounting for 34 percent of output  compared with 90 percent elsewhere -- means that China can convert only 83  percent of its crude steel into rolled steel.
Japan and the United States can convert 95 percent of output.
Poor efficiency among Chinese steel workers -- who each produce 24 tonnes  of steel annually compared to 500 tonnes for Japanese workers -- is another  problem, as is the fact that some 75 percent of equipment in Chinese factories  dates from the 1950s and 1960s.

Pro-democracy movements converged on central  Bangkok Sunday to mark the second anniversary of a May uprising which brought  down Thailand's last military-backed regime.
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai led a wreath-laying ceremony at the Democracy  Monument, a center of pro-democracy protests in May 1992 which degenerated  into bloody clashes between security forces and demonstrators.
Official figures showed 52 people died and another 40 are still officially  listed as missing in riots which, for the first time, had brought Thailand's  emerging middle class into the streets alongside students and politicians.
Police were out in force Sunday as an estimated 2,000 demonstrators  answered a call from the Confederation for Democracy to take part in three  separate marathons ahead of the ceremony at Democracy Monument.
Several events were scheduled in coming days, including a candlelight  ceremony at Democracy Monument at midnight May 18 in memory of those who died.
In February 1991, citing allegations of rampant corruption in the civilian  government, General Suchinda Kraprayoon headed a bloodless military coup which  overthrew Prime Minister Chatichai Choohaven.
After the National Peace-Keeping Council (NPKC) organized elections in  March 1992, Suchinda, who had pledged to stand down, was nonetheless appointed  prime minister, triggering the first of a weeks-long series of protests.
Numbering up to 200,000 by May 1992, demonstrators defied a ban on rallies  to press demands for a return to democracy. Serious clashes on May 19 left  several dead and thousands under arrest.
Thailand's respected monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej, intervened on May 21,  leading to Suchinda's resignation three days later. Elections were held the  following September.

Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, the consortium building  South Korea's second mobile-phone network, has decided to reoffer a share of  the lucrative project rejected by GTE, according to a statement published  Sunday.
The statement was issued Saturday after GTE Corp. rejected the  consortium's proposal to submit a letter of consent by Friday for its four  percent stake.
GTE was among four US companies chosen on Wednesday as foreign equity  partners in the consortium. Pactel Corp. was given a 10 percent stake in the  deal, which provided a 22.2 percent share for foreign participants.
The remaining 12.2 percent foreign stake was shared by Southwestern Bell,  which took seven percent, GTE four percent and Qualcomm 1.2 percent. But GTE,  displeased at the deal, has refused to join the consortium.
Sinsegi, pressured to speed up the delayed project, said it would take  action soon on alloting GTE's stake to other foreign firms, the statement  said.
The coveted project was to have been launched two years ago at a cost of  493 million dollars over the next three years.
The controversy over GTE dates from 1992, when its local partner, Sunkyong  Group, won the initial bid for the mobile-phone license but withdrew it later  amid charges of favoritism because of Sunkyong's family connection with then  President Roh Tae-woo.
After that, GTE threatened legal action against Sunkyong unless South  Korea ensures it the dominant foreign equity role in the consortium.

Several dozen hardline settlers would pray at  the ancient Jewish synagogue in Jericho on Sunday under the protection of the  new Palestinian police, far-right Israeli MP Hanan Porat said.
"Jewish believers will go to the synagogue in coordination with the  Israeli army," said Porat of the National Religious Party.
The army now patrols the area jointly with the Palestinians.
"We do not want any provocation or clashes with the Palestinian police,"  he said.
"But we consider it shameful that Israel has signed an agreement which  puts Palestinians in charge of a Jewish holy place. It's a dangerous  precedent," Porat told state radio.
The group intended to cross into the newly-autonomous enclave from the  north by the Jewish settlement of Naama.
"No one can dictate to us the internal rules in a synagogue," Porat said.  "We will pray and study the Torah (Jewish law) on site all day," he added.
A joint Palestinian-Israeli patrol stopped extremists from the banned  racist Kach movement from praying in the synagogue overnight Friday, Israeli  military sources said.
The Kach members tried to slip into the Shalom al Israel (Peace upon  Israel) synagogue under cover of darkness.
But the patrol, which included Palestinian police who only took up their  new duties on Friday, rumbled the ploy.
The group obeyed the patrol's orders to leave.
Kach was banned by Israel after the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre in  which a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers.
It was the second time that Israelis had tried to get into the synagogue  since the army withdrew from the West Bank town of Jericho on Friday  transferring powers to the Palestinians.
Jewish settlers from Ofra, north of the town, have also tried to enter.
Under the Israel-PLO self-rule deal signed on May 4 in Cairo, the  synagogue is to be administered by the Palestinians in coordination with the  Israeli ministry for religious affairs.

Iranian pilgrims in Mecca will stage a political  rally in Mecca on Tuesday despite a Saudi ban, the head of the Iranian  pilgrimage delegation Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri said Sunday.
Reyshahri, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA, told a group  of pilgrims that holding the "deliverance from the infidels" rally was a  "religious must" and urged everyone to participate.
The anti-US and anti-Israel demonstrations are "aimed at fostering Islamic  unity and enlightening the ummah (Moslems) about the dangers from  disbelievers," he said.
Reyshahri however urged pilgrims to be "disciplined and peaceful" to avoid  any "unseemly incidents."
Saudi authorities warned last week that it would not allow Iranian  pilgrims to carry out their demonstrations.
IRNA said Saturday that the Saudi riot police had taken up positions  around the Iranian pilgrims camps in Mecca to prevent the rallies from being  held.
Police were deployed on both sides of the entrance to the camp, while  about 10 police cars and armoured vehicles were stationed in the streets  opposite, the agency said.
It also charged that two cameras, placed on the roofs of two tall  buildings across the street, were filming all movements to and from the camp  around the clock.
Similar demonstrations have triggered clashes with Saudi police in  previous years, the most violent being in 1987, when 400 pilgrims, including  275 Iranians, were killed. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were  broken off for three years afterwards.
Tehran and Riyadh are also in dispute over the the numbers of Iranian  pilgrims to be allowed in Mecca. Iran says the Saudis have halved its quota of  pilgrims to 60,000.
But Riyadh countered that it was applying a quota system agreed with other  Islamic countries allowing one pilgrim for every thousand people.
The annual Moslem pilgrimage this year is to start on May 19 in Mecca, the  birth place of the prophet Mohammad and Islam's holiest shrine.

The ex-PLO peace talks spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi  explained Sunday she had turned down a job on the new Palestinan Authority not  out of opposition but to focus on a human rights groups she has set up.
"I'm not turning away from responsibility ... I'm working on something  which I believe is important," she told AFP.
"I have a prior commitment to the Palestine Independent Commisison for  Citizen's Rights ... and that's where I feel I can be of most use.
"I feel that the National Authority should have people of commitment,  integrity and credentials. I have chosen where I want to be and that is one  way to participate in building our institutions."
Ashrawi said she had been asked several times, but consistently turned  down the offer.
"My refusal is not an opposition to the authority itself. I have  encouraged everyone to participate in different ways in building our  institutions. Everyone does not have to be in the authority," she said.
Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yasser Arafat named her as one  of 15 members to the new self-rule authority for Gaza and Jericho in a list  forwarded last week to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
PLO chief negotiator Nabil Shaath said the authority would be ready to  take up its duties on Wednesday, by when the transfer of power in the  autonomous areas is expected to be complete.
But Ashrawi is reportedly not the only one to have spurned Arafat.
Israeli television said Arafat had appointed two other members Saturday --  Nablus businessman Munib al-Masri and university teacher Sari Nusseibeh, a  Middle East expert.
The appointments were formally approved in Tunis at a meeting of the PLO's  executive commitee which also nominated Yasser Abed Rabbo, head of the PLO's  information department, to the authority, a committee member Mohammed Zohdi  Nashashibi told AFP in Tunis.
However, sources close to Rabbo said he had asked for time to think about  it.
Ashrawi said her commission was now operational from the West Bank town of  Ramallah.
"The commission is operational already, but we have had some technical  problems such as setting up an office, so we are working from my home for the  moment."

Police have seized 5,000 bottles of alcoholic  drinks in western Iran, arresting 25 people, newspapers reported here Sunday.
Those arrested were members of four alcohol distribution rings in  Oshnavieh region of West Azerbaijan province, bordering Turkey, they said.
Iran has strictly imposed the Islamic ban on alcohol since the 1979  Islamic revolution, although locally-produced and imported alcoholic drinks  are widely available on the black market.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  visit the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of Jericho on Tuesday, a  Palestinian leader said.
"We expect Christopher on Tuesday morning in Jericho," said Saeb Erekat,  who lives in the West Bank town and has been appointed to the new Palestinian  Authority which will run Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
Christopher will be the first senior foreign dignitary to tour the town  since Israeli forces withdrew on Friday.
The secretary is set to arrive in Jerusalem on Monday from Damascus as he  makes another bid to bring the two countries back to the negotiating table.

Nelson Mandela, South Africa's newly-installed  president, plans to step down after just two years in office after overseeing  the introduction of a new constitution, the Sunday Times newspaper said here.
Mandela has "privately hinted he will step down once a final constitution  has been written and he has overseen the country's first steps towards  reconciliation," the paper said, citing ANC insiders.
According to the paper "his determination to give up power well ahead of  the next general election has sparked a power struggle within the African  National Congress," which won a landslide victory in last month's historic  all-race poll.
Mandela, 75, was sworn in as president last Tuesday before an array of  world leaders, the pinancle of a political career which saw move from rural  poverty to lawyer activist, guerrilla commander and languish for 27 years in  jail before leading the ANC's successful election campaign.

A Supreme Court judge has been appointed to start  work as soon as possible as head of a royal commission, some say is two  centuries overdue, investigating corruption in Australia's oldest and biggest  police force.
Attempts by New South Wales police headquarters' officers to get state  Premier John Fahey to rescind the royal commission order and a warning by  Police Commissioner Tony Lauer that it will waste police resources failed to  stop the appointment Friday of Justice James Wood, 53.
Costing 100 million dollars (70 million US), it is the latest in a long  string of judicial inquiries into official corruption, but the first root and  branch probe of a force long suspected of deeply entrenched dishonesty.
Lauer, police chief for three years, will himself be a target after his  "honesty or competence" were challenged in parliament by John Hatton, a  crusading independent MP whose persistent allegations forced the government to  order the commission.
Hatton accused Lauer of compromising corruption investigations as head of  internal affairs, including alleged links between police and murdered  underworld figure, Angelo Duros.
Lauer is also said to have told a "whistleblower" -- a policewoman who  complained about corruption -- she was an outcast.
Another 23 officers, including 10 senior men, have been named by Hatton,  some coming to adverse notice in an intelligence investigation into heroin  trafficking, money laundering, prostitution and car theft.
Lauer denies any impropriety and dismisses suggestions of entrenched  corruption as "figments of political imagination."
Two assistant commissioners are accused of having ordered police  surveillance of three state Labor MPs.
One MP, former state attorney general and now federal adminstrative  services minister Frank Walker, said in an article Sunday that police tried to  smear him and others with false claims of involvement in sex romps with  prostitutes.
Walker said his efforts to weed out corruption and his reforms in areas  such as prostitution, cutting illegal police income, had earned him dangerous  enemies and he had evidence he and other ministers had been put under  surveillance.
"They set up a Swiss bank account to incriminate me and 60,000 dollars was  offered to get dirt on me or frame me," Walker told the Sunday Telegraph.
Among other allegations, the royal commission will be told:
- Police were involved in protecting drug dealers, illegal bookmakers,  prostitutes and practising paedophiles.
- That the US Mafia once bribed a 20-strong squad of detectives to lie  about organised crime in New South Wales.
- That an assistant commissioner leaked information which compromised an  inquiry into police corruption.
- That a former superintendent who was fined 2,000 dollars and discharged  with full superannuation on minor departmental breaches, had been observed  accepting a large amount of money from underworld figure Duros.
- That another superintendent tried to charge and discredit another now  prominent police whistleblower.
- That a superintendent, who headed internal affairs investigations, had  discredited allegations about the involvement of police in two suspicious  deaths and the disappearance of a heroin dealer.
In another article published Sunday, prominent writer turned academic Evan  Whitton said the royal commission was 200 years overdue.
"The corrupt culture was set in concrete by policing authorities who took  over the colony in 1792; they proved to be a gang of organised criminals who  did not shrink from extortion, murder (of Irish political prisoners), and  treason," he wrote.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger starts a  two-day visit here Monday officially focused on an upcoming Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum but with the situation in East Timor likely to  become an issue.
Bolger, who arrived Sunday in Yogyakarta, central Java, begins the  official part of his visit in Jakarta Monday, the first since his predecessor  David Lange in 1988.
Indonesian State Secretary Murdiono said the talks between host President  Suharto and Bolger will mostly focus on "what the two countries could  contribute during the second informal summit of APEC, to be held in Indonesia  in November."
But Bolger's visit comes against a background of rising criticism in New  Zealand over the human rights situation in the former Portuguese colony of  East Timor which Jakarta unilaterally declared its 27th province in 1976.
More than half New Zealand's 97 members of parliament earlier this month  signed a petition expressing concern at the situation in East Timor after  seeing a controversial film on the territory by British journalist John Pilger.
They urged Bolger to express their human rights concerns "in the strongest  possible terms" to the Indonesian government.
Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following  year but the United Nations continues to view Lisbon as the administrator of  the area.
New Zealand Governor General Catherine Tizard added fuel to the  controversy when she told new Indonesian Ambassador Tengku Dahlia Sumolang  recently that East Timor continued to be of concern to New Zealanders.
Wellington's own envoy here, Timothy Grosser, was quick to assure Jakarta  that New Zealand fully recognized East Timor as part of Indonesia. But he  would not say whether Bolger would be raising the issue.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas dismissed the New Zealand MPs as  "only a small group of people with limited knowledge about the latest  developments in our country."
Twenty-five leading New Zealand businessmen are taking advantage of  Bolger's high profile visit to Jakarta to drum up trade in Indonesia. Annual  two-way trade is running at about 200 million US dollars.
Indonesia and New Zealand cooperate closely on various issues at  international fora, including APEC which Indonesia currently chairs.
They are both members of APEC which also includes Australia, Canada, the  United States, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, China, Hongkong, Papua New Guinea,  Taiwan, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
Bolger, who is pushing for closer economic, political and cultural ties  with Asia, leaves Indonesia on Wednesday to visit other member countries of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which groups Brunei,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

China is to lay a 4,000-kilometre (2,480-mile)  fibre-optic cable to ease the burden on the overtaxed telephone network in the  booming southeast, the China Daily Business Weekly said Sunday.
The 1.4 billion yuan (161 million dollar) cable, the longest in China,  will link Hangzhou in Zhejiang province with Fuzhou in Fujian and Nanchang in  Jiangxi, the report said.
The project, to begin in October and be completed by late 1995, is to be  funded in part by World Bank loans for imported sophisticated equipment,  Zhejiang telecommunications official Zhang Bichun was quoted as saying.
Zhang said the exact size of the loan had not been decided and gave no  details of other forms of financing.

Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd. plans to start  providing video game software to homes, using cable television networks, a  newspaper said Sunday.
The unique service enabling people to play computer games at home will  begin in the United States this month and in Japan next month, the Asahi  Shimbun newspaper said.
Users can enjoy various types of video games for about 3,000 yen (29  dollars) a month on the system developed by the major Japanese computer game  maker, it said.

Saudi Arabia has assured the Philippines of crude  oil supply even in times of crisis by virtue of a 40 percent stake in the  country's largest oil refiner, Petron Corp., the energy department said here  Sunday.
A department statement quoted Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro as saying  that Saudi Arabia will also explore ways to expand bilateral economic  cooperation in areas outside the oil sector.
Lazaro made the remarks after accompanying Saudi Arabian Minister for  Petroleum and Mineral Resources Hisham Nazer to a meeting with President Fidel  Ramos on Sunday, the statement said.
Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco), the kingdom's state-owned oil  firm, late last year offered 502 million dollars to win the bid for 40 percent  of Petron and became the Philippines' "strategic partner" in the company.
Manila has retained 40 percent of Petron and plans to sell the remaining  20 percent through the stock market.
Lazaro said Saudi Aramco, which has one of the world's most efficient oil  refining operations, hopes to discuss technology transfer arrangements with  the Philippine government.
Some legislators have said that alleged irregularities in the bidding  process had tended to favor Saudi Aramco and that Petron was sold at a bargain  -- charges denied by energy officials.

The planned sale by the Australian government of  its remaining share of the national flag-carrier Qantas would definitely  proceed "this year or early next year", Finance Minister Kim Beazley said  Sunday.
Qantas management, which had been forced to delay Canberra's original plan  to float the remaining shares this financial year rather than next, were  confident the float would be ready in 1994-95, he said in a televised  interview.
Canberra expects to raise around two billion dollars (1.4 billion U.S.  dollars) in the float of 75 percent of the airline, which follows the trade  sale of 25 percent of Qantas to British Airways earlier this year.
Former finance minister Ralph Willis, who is now treasurer, said last year  that the timing of the float could be delayed until the middle of next year by  share market conditions.
However, Beazley said it would proceed this year or early next.
Questioned also about the possibility of a rise in inflation because of  budgetary measures, he rejected suggestions the government's huge reliance on  business investment to meet its budget targets would drive up inflation rates.
Growth figures of 4.5 percent for the 1994/5 financial year announced in  last week's budget are predicated on 14 percent growth in business investment,  estimated by some at more than 44 billion (312 billion US).
Asked Sunday if such huge extra demands on funds would mean higher  inflation rates, Beazley said Canberra was "not assuming that's going to  occur".
"The economy is in a pretty good state of recovery," he added.
"The sorts of estimates for growth and increases in investment are things  which the economy has absorbed quite easily in the past. There is no reason to  assume that we are so weak that we can't absorb it now."

South Korea expects new high-level talks between  Washington and Pyongyang, despite the North's moves to start refuelling a  controversial reactor without inspectors who want to test whether material has  been diverted for nuclear bombs.
Officials, quoted by the press here Sunday, based their expectations on  two things -- the first that only in a third round of high-level talks would  the crucial question of regular and additional nuclear inspections be tackled.
The second, the unnamed officials said in interviews, was that fuel rod  replacement requires at least 15 days of reactor cooling, meaning that the  start announced by the North Saturday could be interpreted as preparation.
"If the IAEA inspectors arriving in North Korea Tuesday conduct  inspections as scheduled, a third round of high-level US-North Korea talks are  highly likely to be held," South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted one  official in Soeul as saying.
Though both Seoul and Washington interpret the North Korean statement as  saying preparations have started, if it is found to have begun replacing the  rods, then the United States will not hold the third round of talks, the  official said.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are scheduled to  leave Vienna for Pyongyang Sunday on an eight-day inspection trip.
Whether they will be able, on the current trip, to determine any attempted  diversion from the spent fuel rods at the five megawat experimental reactor at  Yongbyong, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of Pyongyang, remains unclear.
US Secretary of Defence William Perry has said that Washington wants to  find out if during a 100-day shut down of the same experimental reactor in  1989 the North tried to extract plutonium to make a bomb.
Perry also warned last month that during the current change the North  could extract enough weapons-grade plutonium to manufacture "four or five  bombs" in addition to the one or two the United States believes it may already  have.
North Korea denies it has any nuclear program, despite its threat a year  ago to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
It also warned last week that it could not delay the rod replacement  process -- with or without IAEA inspectors -- because the time for the change  had fallen due "like the red oil light on the dashboard of a car."
On Saturday it said in a statement carried by its mouthpiece Korean  Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo that the process had begun.
"Refuelling is taking place under the watch of the cameras installed by  the agency (IAEA)," a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
"So there are no grounds for concern about the diversion of the replaced  fuel rods for another purpose," the spokesman said.
In Vienna Saturday night IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the IAEA had  received no official word that refulling had started, and that the agency's  inspectors were still scheduled to leave for North Korea Sunday.
But Kyd cautioned that if refuelling had actually started, it would be a  "grave violation" of existing agrements between North Korea and the IAEA, and  the inspectors would be "immediately recalled."
A foreign ministry spokesman in Seoul, which is in constant close contact  with Washington over the year-long standoff over North Korea's nuclear  ambitions, told AFP Saturday the situation was "far from clear."
But the North Korean spokesman said that Pyongyang was "prepared to store  all the spent fuel under the strict surveillance of the IAEA and fully allow  the IAEA to measure it," when the dispute is settled between North Korea and  the United States.
Analysts here took the phraseology of the North Korean statement as  another sign that the United States and North Korea in low-level talks last  week had already reached an understanding that permission for monitoring the  spent rods was dependent on the third session of talks.

Pakistani police said Sunday they had seized 4.6  tonnes of opium and hashish in separate incidents at the weekend.
Some 4,200 kilograms (9,250 pounds) of hashish were found in secret  cavities on the tanker lorry which was intercepted by police late Saturday on  a highway checkpost.
The vehicle, which was coming from the northwestern region bordering  Afghanistan, was stopped at Attock, 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of here.
The driver and his assistant were arrested, police said. The two were  taking the hashish to the southern port city of Karachi for shipment to an  unknown destination.
In a separate raid in the northwestern district of Haripur, police found  400kg (880 pounds) of opium on a truck, arresting one person while the driver  managed to escape.
The Pakistani parliament recently enacted a law that makes serious drug  offences punishable with death.
There have been a series of major hauls this year, but officials privately  admit the anti-narcotic battle depends on catching big operators who use money  and political links to shield themselves.

Australia may contribute up to 300 army  signallers and engineers to a proposed UN force to protect refugees in Rwanda,  officials said here Sunday.
But a senior Australian Defence Force official (ADF) source said it could  take up to four weeks to prepare the contingent and would be a more difficult  operation than Cambodia or Somalia because of the logistics involved.
The ADF contributed a battalion of 1,100 infantry and supporting units to  the US-led mission in Somalia last year, and about 600 signallers and  helicopter crews joined the successful UN mission in Cambodia in 1992-93.
Resupply for both of those missions was relatively easy, with access for  heavy equipment by sea, but any UN mission in Rwanda would have to resupplied  by airlift or through long, potentially dangerous, road convoys.
Australia was asked late on Friday to contribute to the 5,500-strong UN  force, expected to involve contributions by up to 10 western countries and  based around infantry units from Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal.
Communications equipment and signallers, engineers, medical staff and  equipment, movement controllers, and transport units including helicopters  would likely be supplied by western nations.
Government sources today said the UN request would be "obviously viewed  sympathetically". Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has previously expressed  horror at the the scale of the tragedy in Rwanda.
However, Defence Minister Robert Ray said Australia would only contribute  to the UN force if a political settlement was in place between the two warring  Rwandan factions.
Aid groups estimate at least 200,000 people have died in the bloodbath  which followed the death of Rwanda's president in a suspicious plane crash  April 6.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees have also fled into neighbouring  Tanzania, Zaire, Burundi and Uganda, where they face hunger and disease.
The UN Security Council is expected to vote tomorrow to set up the  mission, although disagreements between the world body and the United States  on the size and duties of the force may delay a vote.
Australian Officials are expected to meet Monday to discuss the UN request,  with a formal recommendation made to the government by mid-week.

A British soldier was killed overnight by a bomb  explosion near an army roadblock in Keady village in southern Ulster, near the  border with the Irish Republic, police said Sunday.
The soldier died shortly after being taken to hospital. Another soldier  was slightly wounded in the attack, which has not yet been claimed.
In another incident in west Belfast, a mixed patrol of British troops and  police fired several plastic bullets at a group of youths throwing stones and  bottles at them.
Four soldiers were slightly hurt. Police did not report any civilian  casualties.

Japan Tobacco Co., a former public corporation which  went under private management in 1985, is to be listed on the stock market in  October, a newspaper said Sunday.
Some 660,000 of its two million shares currently held by the government  will be released on the market in October, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
The finance ministry first wanted to list JT in fiscal 1992, but abandoned  the plan because of the sluggish Japanese stock market.

The Egyptian interior ministry announced the arrest  of almost 100 suspected Islamic militants in a sweep against fundamentalists  who have been leading a two-year campaign to topple the government.
It said 98 people had been arrested following information received after a  police raid on the home of Talaat Yassin Hammam, head of the Jamaa Islamiyya's  (Islamic Group) armed wing, who was shot dead in the incident.
The ministry said late Saturday that the 98 were to appear before a court.
Meanwhile the Egyptian bar association has called a strike Sunday to  protest the death of 32-year-old lawyer Abdel Hareth Madani who died in  detention at the end of April.
The association has said that Madani was tortured to death, and also plans  to march on the headquarters of President Honsi Mubarak on Tuesday to  highlight the case.
But the interior ministry warned "elements supporting terrorism against  any attempts to provoke trouble under any pretext" to protest Madani's death.
The interior ministry said in a statement Saturday that he had died from  an asthma attack before even being questioned. It said his asthma attack had  started at his home and that Madani had been immediately taken to hospital  where he later died.
But earlier in the week the prosecutors' office had said initial autopsies  had shown he had been tortured to death.
Madani had been arrested on allegations that he had been acting as a  go-between for jailed Jamaa members and those living abroad, the ministry  said, adding it had found documents to prove the allegations.
The ministry added that Madani had also been liaising between Jamaa and  the armed wing's leader Hammam.

The Japanese government plans to send a mission to  South Africa later this month to assess ways of boosting economic assistance,  a newspaper said Sunday.
The mission will identify areas where Japanese economic aid can be put to  best use, the Sankei Shimbun said.
Japan is expected to pledge large-scale aid at a Group of Seven  industrialized nations' summit in Italy in July, said the paper.
Last year official Japanese assistance to South Africa totalled only 6.6  million dollars.

A Taiwanese institute is to negotiate the  recruitment of Chinese scientists with a mainland body this month, the United  Daily News said Sunday.
Officials of the Taiwan General Research Institute (TGRI) will discuss  with the Chinese International Technology and Wisdom Cooperation Company,  controlled by China's National Technology Council, on cooperation and  recruitment details, the newspaper said.
Under the plan, Chinese specialists and scientists would work in Taiwan on  one-to-two-year exchange programs. But the paper did not say whether Taiwanese  people will be recruited to work in China.
The Chinese experts are expected to cooperate on development of  high-definition television, the first of a series of technological exchange  programs planned by the insitute, the paper said.

Communist rebel leader Felimon Lagman said Sunday  he would force corrupt police and government officials to make televised  confessions, instead of killing them.
The head of the breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC) of the  underground Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) explained the change of  policy in an interview with the Manila Chronicle newspaper.
Lagman said that kidnapping officials to force public confessions would be  "more damaging" and would instill more fear than death.
He said kidnapped officials will be made to face television cameras,  newspaper and radio reporters and confess their wrongdoings.
Lagman said there would not be a "wave of violence" like that of the Alex  Boncayao Brigade (ABB) in the late 1980s. A policeman was gunned down almost  every week at that time by the hit squad under the MRRC.
"After you kill someone, the furor dies down in two or three days.  Exposing what actually happened will generate greater public awareness," the  rebel leader declared.
The shift in strategy came amid criticism of the ABB morals in handing  down the death sentence on suspected criminals.
Lagman's group claimed responsibility for last week's execution of Timoteo  Zarcal, a former police officer implicated in a kidnapping but acquitted in  court.
Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon has acknowledged that the justice system  -- which heavily favors the rich and takes years for a case to be resolved --  was not perfect. But he appealed to the ABB not to take the law in their hands.
Lagman gave as an example alleged government anomalies the sale of 40  percent of Petron, the country's largest oil refiner, to Saudi Aramco last  year for over 500 million dollars.

Ten people were killed in Thailand when a van  carrying a group of school teachers was crushed in a head-on smash with a  truck, press reports said Sunday.
Nine teachers on their way to a colleagues's farewell dinner were among  the dead, leaving their school in the Ubon Ratchathani province, 629  kilometers (390 miles) northeast of Bangkok, with only one teacher, the  reports said.
Three passengers from the six-wheel truck were in critical condition, the  Daily News said.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  this week try to persuade Syria to set up a joint military commission with  Israel in a fresh bid to unblock their peace talks, a senior official said.
The secretary is expected in Jerusalem on Monday after a day in Damascus  following a shuttle mission at the end of April.
"This trip will aim mainly to establish a military commission between the  two countries," the senior Israeli official said Sunday.
"The commission would draft security arrangements for the border region  and report back to the politicians. Israel would like to have generals sit on  the commission.
"Christopher will try to push this idea with Damascus," he said.
Christopher left the region two weeks ago saying peace efforts had reached  a serious, substantive level after Israel put forward a peace package offering  a phased withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
Israeli officials noted that for the first time Syria had shown  willingness to consider security questions before demanding that Israel give a  prior commitment to surrender all the strategic plateau captured in the 1967  Middle East war.
Now Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wanted to pursue this opening through a  new commission.
A similar commission was set up by Egypt and Israel and helped to bring  the old enemies together in a peace agreement, the official noted.
"The Washington negotiations have reached nowhere so far and this is an  attempt to get round the obstacles," the official said.
The bilateral peace talks began in October 1991 but have stalled over  Israeli demands for a Syrian pledge to agree total peace with open borders and  Syrian counter demands for an Israeli commitment to quit all the heights.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid underlined that security arrangements  were the key. "The security arrangements are at the heart of the problem," he  told state radio.
"Rabin and Peres have already said everything necessary about the scale of  withdrawal and the fate of some settlements," Sarid said.
Rabin, who calls for "total peace", has adopted the formula: "The scale of  the withdrawal will depend on the scale of the peace", and made it clear he is  prepared to sacrifice Jewish settlements in exchange for peace.
In public statements, the secretary and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres have  played down expectations.
"It's a long process," Christopher said in Geneva on Saturday. "I don't  have any great ambitions for this particular trip."
But he added: "I do think the parties are serious and I want to play my  part to take the messages back and forth."
Peres said: "For the time being Syria's proposals do not give us much hope.
However his deputy Yossi Beilin was more positive. "We will be able to see  peace between us and Syria within months."
Christopher's schedule is "flexible", according to officials in Jerusalem.  He might return to Syria if necessary after Monday's talks.
The secretary will visit the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of  Jericho on Tuesday, a Palestinian leader said.
"We expect Christopher on Tuesday morning in Jericho," said Saeb Erekat,  who lives in the West Bank town and has been appointed to the new Palestinian  Authority which will run Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
Christopher will be the first senior foreign dignitary to tour the town  since Israeli forces withdrew on Friday.

Human rights watchdog Amnesty International opened  its first branch in Taiwan Sunday following an improvement in the country's  individual rights.
"The formation of the branch here indicates that our protection of human  rights and elimination of arrest of political prisoners have been acknolwedged  by Amnesty International," Taiwan's Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou, said at the  founding ceremony here.
In future Taiwan would become a "human rights export country," instead of  a "human rights import country," Ma said.
He was referring to the period in the 1960s when thousands of dissidents  were jailed for criticizing the government, prompting Amnesty International  (AI) to ask its members worldwide to express concern over the situation in  Taiwan.
"Now it's time for us to express concern over human rights violations in  other countries, and this makes us a human rights export country," he said,  promising Taiwan would create no more political prisoners in future.
Martial law was imposed in Taiwan in 1949 when the ruling Nationalist  government fled to Taiwan after being defeated by the Chinese communists in a  civil war.
Taiwan, which still considered itself at war with China, enforced the law  until 1987 when relations between the two improved, and in 1990 the government  scrapped a law banning the promotion of independence from China, allowing  exiled dissidents to return to the island.
Previously, most dissidents were imprisoned for advicating the idea of an  independent Taiwan, which the government proscribes. Currently only those  caught using violence to achieve their goal face criminal charges.
Kuo Yi-tung, a former political prisoner better known by his pen name, Po  Yang, is chairman of the Taiwanese AI branch, which has 124 members.
London-based AI was founded in 1961 with branches in 51 countries and  subcommittees in 70 countries.

Popular support for Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's cabinet, formed late last month, stands at 40.9 percent, a Jiji Press  poll showed Sunday.
It was 5.3 points lower than public support given to the cabinet of Hata's  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa shortly after he came to power last August, Jiji  said.
The first Jiji poll on the Hata cabinet questioned 1,400 voters before  justice minister Shigeto Nagano resigned over his controversial remarks on  Japan's military past.
Nagano resigned after saying the 1937 Nanjing massacre in China by  Japanese troops was a fabrication and that Japan did not wage a war of  aggression during World War II.

Nelson Mandela was taking a breather this  weekend at his home village in Eastern Cape province after a hectic two week  schedule that saw his inauguration as South Africa's first  democratically-elected president, the Sunday Times reported.
The newspaper said that Mandela issued instructions that no one be allowed  at his residence in Qunu village.
On Saturday he attended the funeral of Zwelinbanzi Hani, the father of  assassinated South African Communist Party chief Chris Hani who was slain in  April last year.
Mandela's African National Congress swept to power in the April 26-29  election, ending more than 300 years of white-minority rule.

The daughter of assassinated Sri Lankan president  Ranasinghe Premadasa on Sunday demanded a fresh probe into the killing,  accusing the government of failing to carry out a proper investigation.
Dulanjalee Jayakody raised doubts over the government version that the  separatist Liberation Tigerts of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) used a suicide bomber to  blow up Premadasa and 24 others at a May Day rally last year.
"No proper investigation has been done so far," she said. "It is the duty  of any government to find out who killed its head of state. We still don't  know who did it."
The ruling United National Party (UNP) general secretary Gamini Wijesekera   confirmed that Jayakody had asked for a presidential commission to  investigation the assassination.
He said he had seen Premadasa's widow, Hema, and her children Dulanjalee  and Sajith, last week to discuss how the family could help the UNP in  November's presidential election.
The UNP, after its humiliating defeat at a recent local election, has been  wooing the Premadasa family and attempted to resurrect the former leader's  populist policies to win back votes.
"They realise they cannot win without the Premadasa image. No one other  than the members of the family can portray the Premadasa image... We are the  trustees of the Premadasa policies," Sajith said in an interview earlier this  month.
"No other section or faction can vouch for the continuation of these  policies," he added.

South Africa's former government ran up huge  debts of more than 60 billion rand (16.8 billion dollars) in its final year of  power, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.
The money was spent on tidying up the nation's books and settling some  apartheid debts. An economist warned in the report that South Africa's state  debt is approaching danger levels.
Servicing the debt will cost Nelson Mandela's new government 23 billion  rand (6.3 billion dollars) annually and will be the largest item on the next  budget, to be tabled in June, the newspaper said.
Mandela became South Africa's first democratically-elected president  Tuesday after his African National Congress (ANC) swept to victory in the  April 26-29 election.
The former ruling National Party and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom  Party were runners-up. The three parties make up the government of national  unity that was announced Wednesday.
The Sunday Times said total state debt is now more than 200 billion rands  (55.5 billion dollars), about 55 percent of gross domestic product, compared  to 155 billion rands (43 billion dollars) in March last year.
"State debt is approaching danger levels," Mike Brown, an economist at  stockbroker Frankel Pollak Vinderine, told the newspaper.
"The real problem is the rate at which the interest burden is rising  relative to economic growth," he said.
The government is faced with a 13 percent rise in the interest bill from  20.5 billion rands (5.6 billion dollars) in 1993-94 to about 23 billion rands  (6 billion dollars), the Sunday Times reported.

Fire-fighters brought under control Sunday a blaze  at a bomb depot for Russian Pacific fleet warplanes, ITAR-TASS news agency  said, following a massive explosion at the base near the far-eastern Russian  port of Vladivostok.
Overnight rain helped military and civilian fire fighters beat back the  flames at the base, where two armoured vehicles were pressed into service to  help locate the seat of the fire, the agency said.
Saturday's blasts at the base, situated near the village of Novonejino,  shook Vladivostok, 100 kilometres (60 miles) to the south, according to  witnesses cited by the agency.
No casualties were reported in the blast or the ensuing fire.
Several thousand local residents were evacuated from villages in a  30-kilometre (20-mile) radius at the height of the blaze.
The Russian emergency ministry said there were neither chemical nor  nuclear weapons at the depot.
Officials from the Pacific fleet and a counter-espionnage team were sent  to the site Saturday to determine the cause of the explosion, according to  military officials cited by ITAR-TASS.
A special team from the defense ministry left Moscow for the scene  Saturday, the emergency minstry said.

Fighting between Rwandan rebels and government  forces intensified Sunday in several districts of Kigali and in towns across  the country, a UN spokesman in the capital said.
Abdul Kabia, a spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR)  contacted by telephone from here, reported heavy clashes between the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops in the eastern and southeastern  suburbs of Remera and Kicukiro.
Mortar shells also fell in the centre of the capital, he said.
Fighting between the Tutsi-led RPF and the Hutu-majority government side  was also raging in Ruhengeri, a northwest town still held by the regular army,  and at Nkumba further to the north, Kabia said. Clashes were also reported at  Bugesera, south of Kigali.
The RPF claimed on Friday it had won control of half the country.
Kabia added that Dutch Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk arrived in the  capital Saturday on a short visit, inspecting the Amaharo stadium and the  Meridien hotel, two refugee centres.
Former French minister for humanitarian action Bernard Kouchner, who  called Saturday on the international community to help avert "genocide" in the  country, was still in Kigali Sunday, Kabia said.
Rwanda was plunged back into a murderous ethnic war on April 7, a day  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in what the government  denounced as a rocket attack on his plane.
Since then an estimated 200,000 Rwandans have been killed and around  500,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries.

North Flight with Kouichi Tsunoda in the saddle led  a Japanese one-two finish with Towa Darling to win the 1,600-metre (one mile)  Yasuda Memorial race here Sunday.
The four-year-old bay filly got ahead in the final furlong and crossed the  finishing line in one minute 33.2 seconds, two lengths and a half ahead of  Towa Darling.
French colt Dolphin Street, ridden by American Cash Asmussen, came third  followed by Japan's Sakura Bakushin O fourth on the rainy Tokyo Racecourse.
Pre-race favourite Ski Paradise, the winner at the Keio Spring Cup three  weeks ago, could not keep the momentum as the French filly finished fifth with  top Japanese jockey Yutaka Take in the saddle.

Indonesia suffered only a minor hiccup as they  trounced China's men's badminton team 5-0 to finish their Thomas Cup  qualifying group unbeaten.
Joko Suprianto lost the first game of the opening singles against Dong  Jiong on Saturday. He struggled to win the second in which there were three  deuce points. But he made no more mistakes as he went on to win 11-15, 18-16,  15-5.
Heryanto Arbie and Ardy B. Wiranata won their matches against Xie Yangchun  and novice Sun Jun without dropping a game to make sure Indonesia's invincible  reputation suffered no more.
The doubles also went according to plan, with Bambang Suprianto and Rudy  Gunawan, and Ricky Subagya with Rexy Mainaky keeping a clean sheet. Suprianto  and Gunawan had to come back in the first game though against Chinese duo Chen  Kang and Chen Hong Yong.
Indonesia, desperate to win back the Thomas Cup on home territory, have  not lost a match in their qualifying campaign. Despite the drubbing, China  still go through to the semi-finals as runners up in group A to the host  nation.
Sweden took third place in the group after beating Finland 5-0 but drop  out of the tournament.
The semi-final opponents for Indonesia and China were to be decided Sunday  when Denmark face defending champion Malaysia needing a win to take the  runner's up spot from South Korea, who take on Thailand
Uber Cup defending champions China beat South Korea 4-1 in the repeat of  the last final in the women's tournament. The Chinese were forced to deciding  games in three of the five matches but confidently took top spot in their  group.
Japan beat the young Russian team 5-0, losing just one game.
The Chinese and Japanese will have to wait for the results of Sunday's  matches between Indonesia and Denmark and Sweden against Thailand before  knowing who their opponents are.
The semi-finals are on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Syria is willing to discuss an Israeli offer to  leave the Golan Heights on condition it pledges a complete withdrawal within a  "reasonable" time, the government newspaper Tishrin said on Sunday.
The remarks came as US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected  here later in his second peace shuttle to Syria and Israel in a month to forge  a peace deal between the arch enemies.
On his last trip two weeks ago he delivered to Syrian President Hafez  al-Assad proposals from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for a phased  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel conquered in 1967.
Rabin has offered to return three of five Druze villages on the heights as  a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over five-eight years. But details of  the peace plan have been kept secret.
Syria turned down the offer and sent a list of questions to the Israeli  authorities with Christopher demanding clarifications.
Diplomats said the exchange of messages between the arch-enemies was a  good sign of their intentions to try to narrow differences between them.
"The (Syrian) list included some very specific questions which opened the  way for a concrete and serious debate," a Western diplomat in Damascus said.
Meanwhile a senior Israeli official said in Jerusalem that Christopher  would try to persuade Syria to set up a joint military commission with Israel  in a fresh bid to unblock their peace talks.
"This trip will aim mainly to establish a military commission between the  two countries," he said Sunday.
"The commission would draft security arrangements for the border region  and report back to the politicians."
A similar commission was set up by Egypt and Israel and helped to bring  the old enemies together in a peace agreement, the official noted.
Syria's official press also called on the United States to honour a pledge  to play a full partner role in the peace process, saying it was not enough for  Christopher to be a mere postman between them.
"Damascus will not negotiate any Israeli proposals which do not stipulate  a clear engagement for a complete withdrawal in a reasonable time," Tishrin  newspaper said in a front-page editorial.
The commentary, entitled "Will Israel take the adequate decision," went on  to say that the ball lay in the Israeli court "and those who give it support"  referring to the United States.
The English-language Syria Times said progress depended on "Washington  playing its full partner role."
"This role should be effective and not ink on paper," the daily said.
Syrian demand for an Israeli pledge to withdraw totally from the Golan  Heights, which the Jewish state annexed in 1981, has been a major stumbling  block in the peace process.
Christopher, who is in Geneva for talks on the former Yugoslavia, said he  expected the process of reconciling Israel and Syria to be "long."
On Monday he flies to Israel and has not ruled out a return visit to  Damascus before leaving the region on Thursday.
"I do think the parties are serious and I want to play my part and take  messages back and forth," Christopher said.
A Western diplomat in Damascus ruled out any Syrian concessions over the  Golan.
"Syria is not like the Palestine Liberation Organisation," which signed a  peace accord with Israel on May 4 for launching Palestinian autonomy in the  Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, he said.
"Syria will never agree to signing a peace agreement that does not clearly  call for a complete (Israeli) withdrawal from the Golan. It cannot do less  than Sadat. It wants to do better than Sadat," the diplomat added.
The late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat became the first Arab leader to  sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1978 and to obtain a total Israel  withdrawal from the Sinai desert.

Russia's organized crime gangs are making  systematic attempts to gain control of the country's stock of 15,000 tactical  nuclear warheads, a magazine report said Sunday.
In an article in the June edition of The Atlantic Monthly released Sunday,  veteran political commentator Seymour Hersch said there is "powerful evidence  that organized crime in the former Soviet Union has been systematically  seeking access to the nuclear stockpiles with their potential for huge profit."
Citing unnamed government sources, Hersh added that security problems  surrounding the stockpiles were now causing the administration of President  Bill Clinton "a lot of legitimate and deep concern."
Separately, the magazine also charged that the government of the then  president, George Bush, passed on intelligence information to Boris Yeltsin at  the time of the failed August 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev.
A US communications specialist was dispatched to Yeltsin's parliamentary  office to enable the current Russian head of state to place untraceable calls  to a number of military commands to persuade them not to join the coup  plotters, the sources said.
Another US official responsible for monitoring communications within the  Russian defence apparatus was ordered by the White House to inform Yeltsin  that the armed forces had not responded to the coup call, the magazine said.
This information helped Yeltsin, then president of the Russian Federation,  emerge from the crisis with his reputation considerably enhanced.
Previous US reports on the crisis had indicated that Bush had warned  Gorbachev in June 1991 that a coup was imminent, but made no mention of any  intervention on Yeltsin's behalf.

The chairman of the Arab-Islamic Rally party has  been murdered after being abducted, press reports said here Sunday.
Laid Grine, 49, who was also an Algiers lawyer, was found Saturday morning  near Algiers with his throat cut, the reports said.
The lawyer had been captured the previous day by unidentified abductors  from his house at Bordj El Mokhfi east of Algiers.
There has been no official reponse to his kidnapping and murder, but press  reports said he had succeeded Wednesday in gaining the acquittal of an Islamic  fundamentalist being tried by one of the country's special "anti-terrorism"   courts.

The Japanese authorities last year deported a record  70,404 people, according to an official report released Sunday.
Deportations for violating immigration laws rose 3.8 percent from 1992. It  was the first time the number has topped 70,000, said the report by the  justice ministry which controls immigration offices.
Illegal workers accounted for 64,341 of the total, rising 3.5 percent from  the previous year, it said.
Thais topped the list of illegal workers, accounting for 20 percent,  followed by Malaysians with 19 percent, South Koreans with 18 percent and  Iranians with 14 percent, the report said.
The ministry said that the number of foreigners who were denied entry into  Japan last year went down 26.4 percent from 1992 to 18,960.

France's Jacobin Yoma kept his  European Boxing Union super-featherweight title here on Saturday night after  stopping British challenger Neil Haddock in the seventh round.
Haddock's corner threw in the towel after their man was comprehensively  outpunched by the 28-year-old Frenchman fighting before his home crowd. The  Englishman had also suffered badly from the stifling heat.
Yoma was making the third defence of a title he won in June, 1993 with a  points win here over Dutchman Regilio Tuur.

About 30 armed Jewish settlers prayed  at the ancient Jewish synagogue in Jericho on Sunday under the protection of  the new Palestinian police and Israeli army, a correspondent reported.
The group led by far-right Israeli MP Hanan Porat was escorted by Israeli  soldiers into the building on the edge of the town
Porat of the National Religious Party said another group of settlers would  arrive at the synagogue later in the day.
Tensions ran high but there had been no trouble by midday.
"We do not want any provocation or clashes with the Palestinian police,"  Porat said.
"But we consider it shameful that Israel has signed an agreement which  puts Palestinians in charge of a Jewish holy place. It's a dangerous  precedent," Porat told state radio.
Porat crossed into the newly-autonomous enclave from the north through the  Jewish settlement of Naama.
"No one can dictate to us the internal rules in a synagogue," Porat said.  "We will pray and study the Torah (Jewish law) on site all day," he added.
A joint Palestinian-Israeli patrol stopped extremists from the banned  racist Kach movement from praying in the synagogue overnight Friday, Israeli  military sources said.
The Kach members tried to slip into the Shalom al Israel (Peace upon  Israel) synagogue under cover of darkness.
But the patrol, which included Palestinian police who only took up their  new duties on Friday, rumbled the ploy.
Kach was banned by Israel after the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre in  which a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers.
It was the second time that Israelis had tried to get into the synagogue  since the army withdrew from the West Bank town of Jericho on Friday  transferring powers to the Palestinians.
Jewish settlers from Ofra, north of the town, have also tried to enter and  troops removed squatters from the synagogue, including Porat, ahead of  Friday's takeover by the Palestinians.
Under the Israel-PLO self-rule deal signed on May 4 in Cairo, the house of  prayer, which boasts 5th-6th century mosaics, is to be administered by the  Palestinians in coordination with the Israeli ministry for religious affairs.

Rescuers resumed efforts Sunday to  salvage containers lost overboard in the English Channel when a cargo ship  transporting dangerous acids collided with another vessel, maritime  authorities said.
A Dunkirk tug supported by French and British aircraft was due Sunday to  try to salvage eight containers known to be lost from the Taiwan-registered  Ming Fortune, when it collided Saturday in thick fog with the refrigeration  vessel Ariake, the French maritime emergency centre here said.
The 210-metre (230-yard) long Ming Fortune was transporting 1,200  containers, including consignments of toxic materials such as acids and  hydrocarbons, as well as hi-fi equipment, when the collision occurred.
With the Taiwanese vessel continuing to sink Sunday after being badly  holed in the accident, eight containers have so far been spotted floating on  the water.
But a centre officer stressed it was unclear whether any of the floating  containers held toxic products.
"There is no indication that these are metal drums containing dangerous  substances, which would usually be loaded at the bottom of a ship's hold," the  officer said.
Officials said least two other tugs were en route Sunday morning for the  site of the collision in French territorial waters around 30 nautical miles  north of Dieppe-Fecamp.
They added that helicopters could join the search for the containers if   visibility, currently down to around 1,000 metres (yards), improved.
On Saturday helicopters winched crew members of the Ming Fortune to  safety, but its captain and a senior officer were still on board the vessel  Sunday to try to save the ship, and guide French and British salvage and  assessment teams due to arrive at the scene.
British coastguards earlier said all members of both ships' crews had been  accounted for.
The less seriously damaged Panama-registered Ariake, carrying a cargo of  fruit, was taken under tow by the merchant vessel Aberthauw towards Rotterdam.
The collision was fifth such accident in the Channel or North Sea in five  years.

Germany's Michael Schumacher underlined why he is  favourite to win the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday, when he clocked the best  time in the morning warm-up.
Schumacher's Benetton-Ford was two-tenths of a second faster than Mika  Hakkinen's McLaren-Peugeot.
Britain's Damon Hill was third fastest in the Williams-Renault.

Israeli forces had  completed their withdrawal from all but the centre of Gaza City by Sunday as  part of their redeployment from autonomous Palestinian areas, PLO officials  said.
And that was expected to be evacuated by midnight Tuesday.
The Israelis held just two square kilometres (0.8 sq. miles) in the Rimal  quarter which houses the military administration, a jail, the governor's  headquarters, police station, police barracks, a military camp and a document  office.
"There are just these seven places left to evacuate and I think they will  have fully completed their withdrawal by Tuesday at midnight," a senior PLO  official told AFP.
"On Wednesday morning there will not be any Israelis in the town.
"The withdrawal will doubtless take place in the night because they want  to avoid trouble."
All the other positions have been evacuated since Monday night, leaving  the new Palestinian police force in charge of all but the Jewish settlements  on the Strip.
An army spokesman said 1,324 members of the force had entered the Strip  from Egypt and 300 more from Jordan since Tuesday night. Another 426  Palestinian policeman have arrived in Jericho to maintain order, their  commander General Hajj Ismail said.
A total of 7,000 police are due to enter the autonomous enclaves and join  2,000 locally-recruited officers in the new force.
After 27 years of occupation the army is redeploying around the 20 Gaza  settlements to protect the 4,000 settlers during the five-year interim period  of autonomy.
The soldiers who remained on guard in the city appeared tense and nervous.
After being fired on Saturday night at the governor's headquarters,  soldiers riposted wildly shooting in every direction. A Palestinian sitting  playing in a nearby street was shot dead.
And on Sunday, Israeli soldiers ejected two Palestinian policemen from the  area around the old Israeli prison in the city centre where they were visiting  relatives, an AFP photographer reported.
The soldiers checked the policemens' guns were not loaded and told them,  "You have no right to be here, leave immediately."
More Israeli jeeps turned up to check no other police were in the sector.

Khmer Rouge guerillas have  attacked and disabled a bridge on the outskirts of the key Cambodian town of  Sisophon, a Cambodian government officer said here.
About 50 Khmer Rouge guerrillas on Saturday blew up a section of a bridge  which connects Sisophon to the town of Mongkol Borey, eight kilometers (five  miles) east, he said.
The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's supply route, had  been made impassable for large vehicles, according to officer with the  Cambodian-Thai Coordination Office (CTCO).
Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from the structure  and reinforcements had been sent, he said.
Mongkol Borey was believed to have been attacked by Khmer Rouge forces at  the same time, the officer said.
Detailed reports from the area were unavailable.

World squash champion Jansher Khan said Sunday  he would take part in the French Open next week despite being weakened by  influenza.
"I am not yet fully recovered but I am committed to taking part in the  event," he told the Associated Press of Pakistan before leaving here for Paris.
Jansher added "I am a bit short of practise and feeling weak, but  hopefully I will be able to perform well." He is to face Paul Gregory of  England in his first match on Monday.

Mohammad Taleb licked his  ice-cream as he wandered with three friends through the moonlit streets of  Gaza City after midnight.
Since the intifada erupted at the end of 1987, none of the quartet had  been able to taste such simple nocturnal pleasures.
For the past six years there has been a curfew from nightfall until dawn  and those brave enough to venture out risked a bullet in the back from Israeli  soldiers.
"For the first time I am really alive," said the 25-year-old tailor from  Shatti refugee camp along the Gaza seafront.
"I'm so happy. It's unbelievable. I feel like I have become a human being,  free.
"Night meant searches, shooting, shouts ... and plain fear. I used to be  shut up at home. That's over now. It's like coming out of a bad dream."
Warda Street, one of the main commercial thoroughfares, is packed with  people. Gaza is out for a walk, gazing up at the starry canopy.
"I'm sick of television," said Raeh al Batsh, 24. "I was suffocating  inside."
"It is exciting out here. I've never seen my town at night," he said  handing sorbets to his family through the window of his little Fiat.
Traffic is heavy. Gangs of flag-waving youths chant nationalist slogans  from the back of trucks which race up and down.
Fatah Hawks, the armed wing of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream  Palestinian movement, drive by with their guns poking out of car windows.
But just being able to walk unmolested is the greatest pleasure.
"You have to have been deprived for such a long time to appreciate this,"  Mohammad Taleb explained. "Walking slowly .. stopping to greet friends,  looking at the moon rather than the sideboard in the dining room."
Such freedoms began to return last Tuesday night when the first  Palestinian policemen entered the Gaza Strip to assume control of the  newly-autonomous area.
"That night I decided to keep my restaurant open," said Madhad Abu Eloun,  55. A 10 p.m. a jeep pulled up but the soldiers left without saying a word.  Then I knew the curfew was over."
On the other side of the road in the Shifa mosque, the faithful are  kneeling for the Al Ishaa prayer which is said only after dark.
"We could never say it at the mosque because it was too late," said Magid  Arafat, 28, a baker. "Look how many of us there are today.
At a teashop, three ex-soldiers from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA)  walk in arm-in-arm with a brother they met for the first time on Friday.  Drinks are on the house, which soon fills up with well-wishers.
After the ice cream shops, Gazans head for the new temporary police  headquarters, nearly all are men from the PLA.
The road outside is jammed despite the best efforts of the new force to  keep the cars moving.
"This is our new authority," said Oum Mohammad, looking at the renovated  building, all lights ablaze by the Mediterranean.
"After 27 years of occupation, our people are going to maintain order. So  we are curious to see what they look like."

A British carrier was set to fly an empty airliner  into Orly airport here Sunday as the so-called "sky wars" landing rights row  between Britain and France hotted up for a showdown.
Air UK said it would land an empty Fokker plane at Paris's second biggest  airport around 10:10 p.m. (2010 GMT) ahead of a planned return to London with  passengers early Monday.
The 100-seat plane, which if it takes off will become the first  British-operated London-Orly flight, is scheduled to leave at 7:15 a.m.
Up to 10 British airliners from UK Air as well as British Airways (BA) and  its TAT subsidiary plan to fly from Orly Monday in breach of the French ban.
BA, TAT and Air UK are insisting with British government backing that they  are entitled to start flights to Orly Monday in line with a European  Commission ruling last month.
But French authorities have been barring British flights to the airport in  defiance of the decision that ordered France to open three domestic routes --  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles -- to competition.
The flight Sunday was apparently not in defiance of the ban since there  were no passengers.
BA threatened Friday to sue the French government if it stopped the  company's flights, while French aviation authorities were reported ready to  reject the British carriers' flight plans, which under aviation rules would  make it illegal for them to take off from London.
French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson, who has been in constant contact  with his British counterpart John MacGregor in a bid to defuse the row,  refused Saturday to give details of the state of negotiations between the two  sides. A MacGregor spokesman would only confirm that the talks were continuing.
Bosson earlier described the affair as a "storm in a teacup" and predicted  that "everything will be back in order" by Monday.

French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and his  British counterpart John MacGregor reached agreement Sunday on opening Paris's  Orly airport to flights out of London by the end of June at the latest.
In a joint statement here, the two ministers said they would open the  Orly-London link as soon as possible, and certainly "by the end of June."
It remained unclear whether British carriers led by British Airways would  go ahead with plans to start flights into Orly Monday in defiance of a  continuing landing ban by French authorities.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's candidate for upcoming  presidential elections in Germany, Roman Herzog, expressed concern Sunday that  a recent rampage against Africans could tarnish the country's image on the  international scene.
Herzog, speaking during a television interview, said last Thursday's  rampage in the east German town of Magdeburg was "atrocious" and added that he  was concerned the incident could spark "negative reaction on the international  scene, even in countries close to Germany."
The violence involved gangs of skinheads who banded together to hunt down  foreigners, most of them Africans.
Around 50 youths, armed with sticks and knives, turned on a group of  Africans before launching a full-scale manhunt through the streets. According  to police up to 150 youths took part in the violence, in which three people  were reported injured.
Herzog, head of Germany's constitutional court and the focus of recent  criticism because of his conservative views on German citizenship, said the  only way to respond to the violence was "through commitment by the police and  the courts."
German authorities have been heavily criticized for their handling of the  latest violence and public outrage increased after the local prosecutor's  office freed all but one of the 50 arrested, citing lack of evidence.
In response to the public outcry Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has  called an emergency meeting of the committee on legislation in the lower house  for Monday.
It is proposing that police be given powers to hold suspects in custody  for longer without pressing charges and for stiffer penalties for those  convicted of racist attacks.
But it could run into opposition from the Liberal FDP, which maintains  that existing legislation is sufficient so long as it is firmly implemented.
Meanwhile local Christian and Jewish organisations decided over the  weekend to set up their own citizens' watch groups to protect synagogues and  homes for asylum seekers.
Herzog, considered a favorite in the May 23 presidential elections, said  although the racist violence was partly related to "youth facing a bleak  future," that did not justify their actions.
"He who believes he can hit foreigners, set homes on fire and take part in  a manhunt, must understand by all means at the disposal of the state that his  actions will not be tolerated," Herzog said.
The 60-year-old candidate sparked widespread criticism by the opposition  Social Democrats and the local Turkish community a week ago after he suggested  that foreigners who did not wish to adopt German citizenship should leave the  country.
"We must tell those who decide not to adopt German citizenship that they  should return to their country of origin which they apparently consider as  their nation," he said at the time.
Herzog is Kohl's second choice for the presidential elections. His first  hand-picked candidate, Steffen Heitmann, was forced to withdraw in November  because of his controversial rightwing statements.

Firemen brought under control Sunday a blaze  sparked by a huge explosion at a Russian bomb depot which sent potentially  lethal munitions arcing out to a radius of up to 10 kilometres (six miles),  government officials said.
Some of the munitions spewed out from the centre of Saturday's blast at  the isolated depot for Russian Pacific fleet warplanes could still be in  danger of exploding, the Russian ministry for emergency situations said in a  statement cited by the ITAR-TASS agency.
But it was now safe for the 2,500 people evacuated Saturday from villages  in a 30-kilometre (20-mile) radius around the base to return home, the  ministry added.
The blaze was sparked by the explosion at the base around 100 kilometres  (60 miles) northeast of the far-eastern Russian port of Vladivostok.
The blast shook the port itself, according to witnesses in the city cited  by the agency.
No deaths were reported in the blast or the ensuing fire, but six people  were injured by flying glass.
However, some 200 of the depot's 800 transport wagons were destroyed, as  well as part of the railway line leading to the base.
All wooden buildings inside the depot compound, which covers six square  kilometres (2.4 square miles) were gutted, and houses in the surrounding  villages were damaged.
The head of the local council, Yevgeni Nazdratenko, told ITAR-TASS the  explosion was a "great tragedy" for the region.
"It is a sad consequence of our totalitarian past," he told the agency.  "The former Soviet Union was armed to defend its borders, but today this  surplus of weapons is being turned back against Russia."
The emergency situations ministry said there were neither chemical nor  nuclear weapons at the depot.
Overnight rain helped military and civilian fire fighters beat back the  flames at the base, where two armoured vehicles were pressed into service to  help locate the seat of the fire, the agency said.
Officials from the Pacific fleet and a counter-espionnage team were sent  to the site Saturday to determine the cause of the explosion, according to  military officials cited by ITAR-TASS. No details of their investigations had  been released Sunday.
A special team from the defense ministry left Moscow for the scene  Saturday, the emergency situations ministry said.

Rival troops in Yemen's civil war squared  up for a major battle for control of a key southern base near Aden Sunday, as  northern leaders pressed on for a military victory over the south.
Southern troops Sunday prepared artillery defences around Markula, a  mountain village about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Aden, to block a northern  advance on the huge Al-Anad military base further south.
Nearly all the inhabitants of Markula and nearby villages had fled south  toward Aden.
The commander of the Al-Anad base, 50 kilometres (31 miles) from the  southern port city, said the battle would "last a long time."
"Our army is fighting a defensive war. The northern army has taken the  initiative in the conflict and is advancing on several fronts, but they  haven't made a decisive breakthrough."
The Al-Anad base, stretching over several square kilometres, "is the  (southern) joint command centre for all the military fronts," said the  officer, who asked not to be named.
Some 20,000 southern troops were based there, he said. Al-Anad is also a  major air force base.
It was at the gateway to Aden, stronghold of southern leader Ali Salem  al-Baid, the Soviet-trained officer explained, "and that's why (President) Ali  Abdallah Saleh wants to seize it at all costs."
In the past few hours Saleh's commanders had sent two brigades to the  Kirsh front, 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Al-Anad, and three to Daleh, a  strategic town close to the old pre-unification border, which fell to northern  troops after several days of bitter fighting last week.
Three northern brigades were sent to Kharaz, a region west of Aden near  the strategic Bab al-Mandeb Straits, gateway to the Red Sea, and three more to  the Abyan region just east of Aden, the officer said.
A military spokesman in Sanaa confirmed that northern forces "are  continuing their advance to smash through the defences around Al-Anad."
Meanwhile an Arab League delegation visiting Sanaa failed to broker a  ceasefire as the civil war entered its eleventh day.
The delegation was received by Abdel Aziz Abdel Ghani, member of the  collective presidency, who said northern leaders would back a ceasefire only  if "war criminal" Baid surrendered and if the constitutional legitimacy of  Saleh's government was recognised.
Baid, the Yemeni vice president, was stripped of his functions in the  first days of the fighting.
Although southern officials in Aden have called on the Arab League to step  in to end the fighting, so far northern leaders have ruled out any foreign  intervention in the civil war, which they consider an "internal matter."
They rejected Friday a southern peace plan which called for an immediate  ceasefire and the establishment of a national unity government.
The conservative North and formerly Marxist South Yemen united in May 1990  after long and delicate negotiations, but a simmering feud between Saleh and  Baid erupted into full-scale war on May 5.
Official Sanaa Radio said northern forces were advancing on all fronts and  "inflicting heavy losses" on Baid's army.
The radio, monitored by the BBC, said Saleh's troops had pounded  fortifications near Al-Anad, and were moving from the Kharaz area east toward  the Salah-al-Din camp.
"They seized large quantities of hardware, vehicles ... and a marine radar  station," it said.
On Saturday two SS-20 missiles fired toward the Al-Anad base fell in the  desert.
The base is hidden from the road behind sand banks and heavily defended by  anti-aircraft guns.
A Scud missile fired by southern forces exploded in a vineyard on the  outskirts of Sanaa late Saturday, but there were no casualties. It was the  20th Scud to be fired at the capital.
At least 25 civilians were killed when a Scud slammed into a  densely-populated area of Sanaa at dawn Wednesday.

French and British transport ministers Bernard  Bosson and John MacGregor reached agreement Sunday on opening Paris's Orly  airport to British airline flights by the end of June.
In a joint statement released here, the two ministers said they would open  the Orly-London link as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of June.
The British government agreed to ensure that British carriers led by  British Airways (BA) cancelled plans to start flights to and from Orly Monday  in defiance of a current landing ban by French authorities, a spokesman for  the French transport ministry said.
On the French side, outstanding technical problems would be resolved in  the context of existing European (Union) regulations, the statement said.
In Britain problems faced by French carriers to gain landing slots at  British airports "will be examined with the same openness" and in the context  of EU rules on slot allocations, the statement added.

Suspected Moslem militants shot dead a  policeman Sunday in the troubled Asyut region of Upper Egypt, police said.
Two gunmen opened fire on a taxi carrying policeman Mohamed Ahmed Goweid  in the village of Sedfa. They then fled the scene, making off with the  policeman's gun.
Three policemen were shot dead Friday in separate incidents in southern  Egypt. A fourth was also wounded.
The outlawed Jamaa Islamiyya (Islamic Group) later said it carried out an   attack on a police station in Badari, some 400 kilometers (240 miles) south of  Cairo, in which two of the policemen were killed.
It said its militants also shot dead a third policeman a few hours later  as he left home in nearby Abu Tig.
A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said Friday's two  attacks were "part of a series planned to avenge the murder" on April 25 of  Talaat Yassin Hammam, the organisation's military leader.
The armed group has adopted the name Talaat Yassin to honour Hammam, who  was shot dead in a police raid on his home.
The interior ministry said Saturday 98 suspected militants had been  arrested in Cairo, Ismailia on the Suez Canal, and in the Nile Delta and Upper  Egypt, following intelligence gathered after Hammam's death.
It said it had also seized about 80,000 dollars and a large quantity of  arms, ammunition and explosives.
It said several leaders of armed operations had been arrested as well as  those in charge of finances and communications.

A senior Taiwan official warned Sunday that  restrictions on links with China could not be lifted until there was a proper  and open inquiry into the killing of 24 Taiwanese tourists.
"We are not ready to remove the curbs yet," said Yeh Chin-feng, vice  chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), in a warning  that relations risk remaining cool.
The tough stance comes after a delegation investigating the tragedy  returned from China unhappy with the way the inquiry is being handled.
Taiwan cut off tourist, cultural and educational ties with China over the  March 31 deaths of the tourists, who were robbed and killed on a pleasure boat  on Lake Qiando, in eastern China.
Thirty-two people on a sightseeing trip, including six Chinese crew and  two guides, died when robbers apparently locked them in a room before setting  the vessel ablaze.
China originally insisted the deaths were accidental. But authorities have  since charged three people with murder, arson and robbery and a fourth man is  accused of hiding loot from the raid.
But Yeh said the MAC -- the top policy planner for dealing with Beijing --  would only consider resuming cultural, educational and tourism exchanges after  Beijing provided a reasonable account of the incident and paid compensation to  families.
The MAC released a statement Saturday saying China had not given  satisfactory answers to key queries raised by the fact-finding delegation, led  by Shi Hwei-you, Deputy Secretary-general of the semi-official Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF).
Shi told reporters after his return Saturday that requests to examine the  victims' autospy reports and to interview witnesses and suspects had all been  rejected.
Taiwan has said that Chinese accounts claim that only two of the three  suspects went aboard the pleasure boat to rob and kill the passengers, while  the third man watched from a speed boat.
"How could you imagine two people doing this, when there were 32 people on  board?" Chen Chin-shih, one of the victims' relatives and a member of the  delegation, asked.
Taiwan has charged that about ten people, including Chinese soldiers, were  involved in the case, and relatives of the victims have accused mainland  authorities of hiding the truth about the lake incident.
But Beijing has refuted this as fabrication, saying Taiwan "should be  satisfied" with the investigation and stop using the tragedy as a political  excuse to block ties.
Yeh said she hoped Beijing would seriously study questions posed by the  delegation and punish those involved appropriately.
Meanwhile, Taiwanese travel agencies called for a lifting of the package  tour ban after the delegation's return, as the lost business is costing them  money.
And the chairman of Taiwan's largest opposition party, the Democratic  Progressive Party (DPP), Sunday said his party was willing to work with China  and to coexist peacefully with it.
"The people in Taiwan are willing to stretch out their hands of  friendship, hoping to establish a peaceful coexistence relationship with the  Chinese communists," newly elected DPP chairman Shih Ming-teh said in his  inauguration ceremony here.
"We are willing to treat the Chinese communists as brothers, helping each  other, but the Beijing regime must abandon its ambition to invade and take  Taiwan by force," he said.
Taiwan and China have been at loggerheads since Nationalists fled China  for Taiwan in 1949 after being defeated by the communists in a civil war.
Each government regards itself as the legitimate ruler of all China, while  Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province.

President Nelson Mandela faces a week in  which he must start plotting South Africa's future following historic all-race  elections.
In charting a course for South Africa, Mandela faces an enormous task in  trying to meet the expectations of the black majority, reassuring the white  minority, enticing foreign investment and stamping out political violence.
On Tuesday he will deliver a speech in parliament in Cape Town in which he  is expected to spell out the government's plan for the future following the  African National Congress' victory in April 26-29 elections.
The new National Assembly, or parliament, convenes on May 23 for a session  that is expected to last about a month. It met for the first time on May 9  when Mandela was elected as president and 400 parliamentarians were sworn in.
Already the relative peace that has held since the election has been  shattered by the massacre by gunmen of 12 people aged between 13 and 25 in  Tokoza black township, east of here, Friday night. Ten of the victims were  lined up against a wall and shot execution-style.
The killings have sparked fears of renewed clashes in Johannesburg   townships between residents supporting the ANC and Zulu-nationlist Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) supporters who live in migrant worker hostels.
Last year at least 1,600 people were killed in the eastern townships,  which have borne the brunt of political violence that has claimed 10,000 lives  countrywide in the four years since former president Frederik de Klerk lifted  a ban on the ANC.
But Mandela can take heart from the words of IFP leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi -- now a minister in the government of national unity -- who  Saturday urged his supporters to work for reconciliation and peace with their  political foes.
"Go out and break down the barriers that divide you from your political  oponents," he said at a rally to celebrate his party's election victory in his  KwaZulu-Natal province power-base.
Although the ANC won a resounding victory in the national poll, it lost to  the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal.
The IFP came in third nationally, after the former ruling National Party  (NP), and together the three parties make up the government of national unity  which will last for five years until the next elections.
Buthelezi told his supporters that peace was essential to ensure economic  development.
"No businessman will want to invest in this region if his life is in  danger," he said. "No investor will want to build factories if their factories  are going to be burned down."
One of Mandela's major tasks will be to rectify an economy wrecked by the  former white-minority government, which left him with a mountain of debt,  according to the Sunday Times.
The newspaper said Sunday that De Klerk's government ran up debts of more  than 60 billion rands (16.8 billion dollars) in its final year of power.
Servicing the debt will cost the new government 23 billion rand (6.3  billion dollars) annually and will be the largest item on the next budget, to  be tabled in June, the newspaper said.
Mandela will also have to find the money for an ANC plan aimed at creating  jobs, building homes, encouraging investment and finding ways of encouraging  and rewarding productive enterprise in disadvantaged communities.
Mandela said last week that he was determined that the 39 billion rand (12  billion dollar) plan be implemented and that he would fight any opposition to  it in the government of national unity.

British Airways cancelled Sunday planned flights to  Paris's Orly airport, averting an international showdown over landing rights  minutes after France and Britain agreed to open the airport to flights out of  London by the end of June.
In a joint statement released here, French Transport Minister Bernard  Bosson and his British counterpart John MacGregor said they would open the  Orly-London link as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of June.
In London a spokesman for British Airways (BA),told AFP the carrier had  decided to cancel its London-Orly services planned for Monday.
The scheduled flights would still go ahead but would be rerouted to  Paris's northern Charles de Gaulle airport, the spokesman said.
No mention was made in the joint statement to the cancellation of Monday's  flights.
On the French side, outstanding technical problems would be resolved in  the context of existing European (Union) regulations, the statement said.
In Britain problems faced by French carriers to gain landing slots at  British airports "will be examined with the same openness" and in the context  of EU rules on slot allocations, the statement added.

After years of struggling  with the occupying army to obtain passes to enter Israel, Gazans learned  Sunday they would now have to go through the new Palestinian police first.
"Requests will have to be made in our offices for our approval and then be  handed on to the Israeli army for their approval," a senior PLO official told  AFP.
Palestinians were not looking forward to the double procedure.
"Before I used to call the military administration and an army patrol  would accompany the Israeli lorry carrying gas bottles to my factory in Deir  el Balah," said factory owner Mohammad al Tilbani.
However, since Palestinian police took charge of the area last week the  deliveries have had to stop.
"So now I have to go and fetch gas myself from Israel. But when I called  the military administration, I was told from now on to go through the  Palestinian police.
"I made my request but they told me they were too busy deploying policemen  in different barracks and to come back tomorrow."
"I don't know how they will function in the future, all I know is that I  have 85 workers who have nothing to do and a Moslem holiday starts on  Saturday," said Tilbani, who makes cakes and biscuits.
"If we don't work now, people will buy Israeli cakes and our economy will  collapse."
The 3,900 Gazans with the old permits to work on Israelis farms  nonetheless went to work as usual on Sunday.
The permits will remain valid until their expiry date when the workers  will also join the queue outside the offices of the new force.

UN inspectors left for North Korea Sunday amid  reports that Pyongyang has gone ahead with a controversial replacement of  reactor fuel rods, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.
The agency had said the inspectors would not make the trip unless the  reclusive Stalinist state agreed to postpone the fuel rod replacement. But on  Saturday the agency said it was not clear if the process had begun and wanted  to see for itself.

Two British carriers on Sunday cancelled flights to  Paris' Orly airport, averting a showdown over landing rights after France and  Britain agreed to open the airport to services out of London by the end of  June.
In a joint statement, French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and his  British counterpart John MacGregor said they were committed to opening the  Orly-London link to air traffic "as soon as possible and at the latest by the  end of June."
Meanwhile spokesmen for British Airways (BA) and Air UK told AFP their  companies had decided to cancel inaugural London-Orly services that had been  planned for Monday.
The scheduled flights, out of London's Heathrow and Stansted airports,  would still go ahead but would be rerouted to Paris's northern Charles de  Gaulle airport, the spokesmen said.
Until now all London-Paris flights have used the Charles de Gaulle airport.
BA chairman Colin Marshall said in a statement he was delighted that the  French government had agreed to open the link, adding that the company had now  secured its objective of running a service into Orly.
He said he was certain that outstanding problems could be resolved before  the end of June.
A spokesman for the Paris ministry said that, under the accord, London had  agreed to ensure that BA, its TAT subsidiary, and Air UK cancelled their plans  to start flights into Orly, south of Paris, Monday in defiance of a landing  ban by French authorities.
The ministries' statement said that on the French side, outstanding  "safety, environmental and congestion problems" would be resolved openly and  in line with existing European (Union) regulations.
And in Britain problems faced by French carriers to gain landing slots at  British airports, particularly Heathrow, would be examined with the same  openness and in the context of EU rules on slot allocations, the statement  added.
Up to 10 British airliners from the three carriers had planned to use Orly  Monday in breach of the French ban.
They earlier insisted with British government backing that they were  entitled to start flights to Orly Monday in line with a European Commission  ruling last month.
But French authorities continued to bar British flights to the airport in  defiance of the decision, which ordered France to open three domestic routes  -- Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles -- to competition.
BA had threatened Friday to sue the French government if it stopped the  company's flights, while French aviation authorities were reported ready to  reject the British carriers' flight plans, which under aviation rules would  make it illegal for them to take off from London.
Bosson, who has been in constant contact with MacGregor since Friday,  earlier described the affair as a "storm in a teacup" and predicted that  "everything will be back in order" by Monday.
He had cited congestion at Orly, environmental considerations and  increased access to London's Heathrow airport for French carriers as issues  which needed to be resolved before the route is opened.
A fourth UK airline -- British Midland -- had earlier delayed the start of  its four-flights-a-day Heathrow-Orly service until the row is resolved.

report
CANNES, France, May 15 (AFP) - Americans visit the cinema nearly twice as  often as any of their film-going counterparts in other industrialized  countries, according to a report released here Sunday.
But the survey, by the National Cinematographic Centre, shows that almost  99 percent of the films they see are US productions. US films hold between 50  and 85 percent of the market in other western countries.
The report showed that the average American visited the cinema 3.9 times  annually, with 98.7 percent of the box-office takings going to American-made  movies.
Their nearest rival in enthusiasm for the silver screen was Spain, with  2.1 visits per capita annually, followed by France (two), Britain (1.8), Italy  (1.4) and Germany (1.3).
Of the countries surveyed in the report, Japan came bottom with an average  of one visit to the cinema per person last year.
The survey, released annually on the sidelines of the Cannes International  Film Festival, revealed -- if it needed revealing -- that Steven Spielberg's  "Jurassic Park" was far and away the global hit of last year.
The film topped box office takings in most of the countries surveyed, and  took 868.1 million dollars worldwide, of which more than 60 percent was taken  outside of the United States.
In breakdowns of figures for the various countries surveyed, one of the  most startling was a 23 percent increase in admissions from 1992 to 1993 in  re-unified Germany.
France retains its "preponderant role in European film-making," with 70  international co-productions and a number of foreign directors, notably  Poland's Krzysztof Kiesloswki, choosing to make films in the country.
In Britain, the survey noted that the domestic cinema industry was  continuing its slow recovery, with a 8.3 percent increase in film production  last year and a 21 percent increase in investment.
But it noted that the leap in funding was largely accounted for by two  films with American backing: Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Mary Shelley's  "Frankenstein," and Neil Jordan's "Interview with a Vampire."
The report, which takes its information from cinematic authorities in each  country, showed that over the last decade, overall cinema admissions worldwide  have fallen from 659 million to 558 million, a drop of 18 percent.

Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff reckons his team  cannot fail to win the European Cup after his title-winners' latest miracle in  the Spanish league.
Barca, who face AC Milan in Wednesday's cup final in Athens, won their  fourth consecutive championship on Saturday night -- and their third victory  to be sealed on an amazing final day.
They cut it fine this time, winning on goal difference after thrashing  Sevilla 5-2 before 95,000 adoring fans, while long-time leaders Deportivo La  Coruna finished 0-0 with Valencia after missing a late penalty.
Barcelona had won their previous two titles after leaders Real Madrid were  beaten on both of the last days, ironically by the same club, Tenerife.
Cruyff said: "I never gave up hope when I heard that Deportivo had a  penalty. Everyone thinks that it's easy, but I knew that it would be difficult  for Miroslav Djukic because he had the weight of all Galicia on his shoulders.
"At a time like that, 11 metres seem more like 110."
However, the Dutchman paid tribute to his rivals, saying that "Deportivo  have had a great season", while Depor's president Augusto Lendoiro accepted  that Barcelona were the rightful champions.
According to Cruyff, the key to their 1994 triumph was being walloped 6-3  by Real Zaragoza in February.
"We were hurt," he admitted.
But Cruyff's deputy, Rexach, added: "We have great mental strength, a  winner's self-belief. We showed it last week at Madrid last week (beating Real  1-0) and we showed it again on Saturday."
Barca's devastating sprint to the finish, after an uncertain start to the  season, saw the Catalan club earn 28 points out of 30 in their last 15 games.
It's a performance which Cruyff believes will see them in good stead on  Wednesday night.
"To have won so many matches for the past three months, I ask myself how  we can lose the European Cup," he said.
Deportivo's Serb libero Djukic missed his penalty just two minutes from  the end.
The club's agony was deepened by the fact that they had been on top of the  league for 25 weeks -- and that the title would have given their first  domestic trophy in their history.

Fighting raged Sunday between the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army and Bosnian Serb troops near the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla,  the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said in a statement.
The heaviest clashes were centered on the region of Brgule, south of  Tuzla, where members of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) counted 170  explosions along the battle front Saturday.
The UN soldiers reported that they counted more than 150 detonations in  nearby regions including Olovo, Dastansko and Vares.
UNPROFOR added that 92 detonations were heard Saturday in the region of  Sapna, southeast of Tuzla, where a UN armoured vehicle was targeted by machine  gun fire that did not cause any casualties.
It said that fighting was also reported north of Tuzla and confirmed  earlier reports that the Bosnian army was gaining ground and had captured  about 10 square kilometres (four square miles) of territory in the Vijenac  region.
Meanwhile the situation was reported relatively calm throughout the rest  of Bosnia Sunday.
A Serb checkpoint along the road leading to Sarajevo airport was reopened  after being shut down Saturday after a Serb soldier was wounded by sniper fire.
In Sarajevo, UN observers Saturday reported that the Serbs had violated  the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the capital by  placing two anti-aircraft guns inside the area.

President Bill Clinton has learned the hard way  that talking tough with Washington's major trading partners in Asia is not the  way to win concessions from China or Japan.
Despite his insistence that trade is the key to boosting the domestic  economy, and that Asia as the world's fastest-developing region is vital to US  trade, Clinton has embroiled himself in economic disputes with both Beijing  and Tokyo.
Clinton has to decide in the next three weeks whether to disrupt the  entire US-China trade relationship because of Beijing's human rights record --  a quandary of his own making after he linked the two last year.
With Japan, his tough tone has resulted in bilateral trade talks breaking  down altogether, although both sides say they want to return to the  negotiating table and the fallout has been less than in the China case.
Whatever Clinton does on China he will face criticism -- either from the  powerful business lobby who say withdrawing China's privileged trade status  would be the equivalent of an economic nuclear bomb, or the human rights lobby  who say China has failed to meet Clinton's conditions for progress.
But the experience has been a salutary lesson for the Arkansas state  governor who made much during his election campaign of President George Bush's  "coddling" of a repressive Beijing government and pledged to be much tougher.
One of Clinton's basic problems was that "when he was campaigning and when  he took office he was ignorant of the Far East," said Penelope  Hartland-Thunberg, an economist with the Center for Strategic and  International Studies (CSIS).
He had visited Japan, but as governor of Arkansas seeking to sell his  state's products, not as a national statesman.
As for China, Clinton seemed to regard it as just another developing  country rather than a major force in world politics and a potential third  superpower, Hartland-Thunberg said.
Clinton lived up to his campaign pledges in May last year, issuing an  executive order saying that he would not renew China's most favored nation  (MFN) trading status beyond June 1994 unless it made "significant, overall  progress on human rights."
But he rapidly changed his rhetoric as it became apparent that his policy  of keeping Beijing at arm's length until it started meeting his conditions was  not working.
In September Clinton adopted the line of "constructive engagement,"  involving a flurry of visits to Beijing by senior US officials.
But then economic officials in Clinton's own administration backed big  business' cry that withdrawing MFN, putting at risk a 40 billion dollar a year  trade relationship and 160,000 US jobs, would be a self-defeating disaster.
These mixed signals from Washington encouraged Beijing to think that there  was no danger of losing MFN and weakened the incentive for it to comply with  Clinton's conditions, many analysts here say.
A panel of experts chaired by former US Secretaries of State Henry  Kissinger and Cyrus Vance sent a report to Clinton this week urging him to  work behind the scenes with Beijing to persuade the Chinese to make the  necessary human rights moves by June 3 in return for a pledge not to condition  future MFN.
For the future, they urged Clinton to develop a more balanced relationship  with Beijing in which human rights would be pursued through such channels as a  bilateral human rights commission.
They also warned that Clinton cannot afford to be at odds with two of its  major Asian partners at once.
"For Washington simultaneously to alienate both Tokyo and Beijing, for  example, could produce a shift in alignments that would be of historic  magnitude and highly adverse to America's national interests," the explained.
Clinton has so far been unable to resolve the trade dispute with Japan,  which centers on disagreement over ways to measure progress in opening Japan's  markets and reducing its 60 billion dollar trade surplus with Washington.
But US-Japanese trade talks have a history of Japan being forced into  taking action, and things have been complicated by domestic political upheaval  which has seen three Japanese prime ministers in less than a year.
Both sides insist they do not want a trade war, and are hoping to hold at  least informal discussions in the next month or so.

Some 175 Somalis in a refugee camp near the  southern Yemeni town of Aden have been killed in the civil war raging there,  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Sunday citing residents of  the camp.
The provisional death toll, which did not include wounded casualties, was  transmitted to a UNHCR representative and a Red Cross official in Yemen who  both reached the camp Saturday, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said.
"The people in the camp are very frightened, without food nor water,"  Redmond said.
He said that, of the 11,600 refugees earlier registered in the camp  located beside the Indian Ocean, only about 1,500 remained.
The rest had fled the fighting between Yemen's northern and southern  factions by heading toward Aden or other regions, he added.
He said the UNHCR and the Red Cross were debating whether to evacuate the  camp's remaining refugees to safer areas.

Several people were reported killed when Khmer  Rouge guerrillas attacked a bridge and an administrative building in Mongkol  Borey, northwest Cambodia, a western aid official said here Sunday.
A number of people were admitted to hospital following the attack on  Saturday. The number of deaths and casualties could not be confirmed by the  official, in contact with Mongkol Borey by radio.
A Cambodian government officer across the Thai border in Aranyaprathet,  said 50 guerrillas blew up a section of a bridge on a road connecting Mongkol  Borey to the strategic town of Sisophon, eight kilometers (five miles) to the  east.
The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's supply route, had  been made impassable for larger vehicles, according to the officer with the  Cambodian Thai Coordination Office.
Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from the structure  and reinforcements had been sent in, he said.

The world market for environmentally friendly  technology, presently at 200 billion dollars and growing, is attracting an  increasing number of US businesses targeting Asian nations.
This sector is clearly strengthened since the first international  environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The industry benefits from the  Clinton administration, which has staked a strong interest in cleaning up the  environment as well as spurring the development of "green technologies" to  increase US exports.
The administration has encouraged the latter by subsidizing exports  through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The  industry profits as well from World Bank interest in environmental protection.
This golden opportunity, which could reach 600 billion dollars in the year  2000, is equally coveted by the French companies Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez and  Generale des Eaux, and the German firm Siemans.
In the United States, the firms range in size from giants like WMX  Technologies (formerly Waste Management), with 10 billion dollars in business  for 1993, and Bechtel, with 7.3 billion dollars, to the average-sized like  Solarex, at 30-35 million dollars, or smaller ones such as Spire or United  Solar.
Exports are critical for waste treatment technologies and for those  centered on pollution prevention. Solarex exports around 65 percent of its  solar panel production, mainly to western Europe and Asia.
The Asian market, currently estimated at 80 billion dollars, could reach  120 billion before the turn of the century.
To profit from this windfall, the United States in 1992 launched the Asian  Environmental Partnership (AEP) a cooperative effort with Asian countries  which has already rendered 400 million dollars in clean technology sales.
"We are committed to achieve five to 10 billion dollars into the next five  years" in this framework, said an AEP source speaking on condition of  anonymity.
"Asia is attractive because economies are strong, it offers political  stability and there is interest in environmental issues. And you know that  they will pay," said William Brown of WMX, the world's leading waste treatment  corporation.
The principal export targets are Taiwan, which could release 30.5 billion  dollars for the environment over six years; South Korea with 11.4 billion  dollars over five years, and Hong Kong with six or seven billion dollars  before the year 2000.
However, all covet the fabulous Chinese market, which could reach 35  billion dollars before 2000. In comparison, Mexico and Brazil, the main Latin  American markets, spend two and one billion dollars respectively.
Malaysia and Indonesia also hold future potential, in spite of their  apparent reticence to adopt stronger environmental regulations and open their  market wider to foreign technologies.
In these nations, "There is a very strong push for environmental domestic  policies," said the AEP source adding, "so, they send mixed signals abroad."
Environmental issues arose during May 6 talks in Washington between  Clinton and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed, but nothing has leaked  out of these discussions.

Thirty armed Jewish settlers  prayed at the synagogue in Jericho on Sunday for the first time since  Palestinian policemen were posted at the entrance.
"I didn't see any Arab policemen. They don't exist," said rabbi Mordechai  Rabinovich after filing past three Palestinians in olive-green uniforms and  carrying Kalshnikov assault rifles.
"I saw only our soldiers and they alone protect us against terrorists,"  said the rabbi who runs the Jericho yeshiva, or religious studies centre.
The settlers too were armed, most with Uzi machine pistols, as they  entered the building, eyes on the ground to avoid acknowledging the  Palestinians who took control of their first autonomous enclave on Friday.
The policemen looked at the Jews' army escort, Colonel Aviezer, who is in  charge of the area for Israel.
"It's authorized," he told one of the men who opened the gates bearing the  inscription Shalom al Israel, or peace be upon Israel.
Once inside, the rabbis' disciples took their seats on benches and  immediately started praying.
Far-right Israeli MP Hanan Porat of the National Religious Party  accompanied the settlers, as did another rabbi, Eliezer Waldman, who played a  leading role in the Jewish occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"I am ashamed for the Jewish people and our army," moaned the rabbi  without lifting his eyes from his Talmud.
"As far as I am concerned I will never recognize terorrist authority over  these territories."
A teenager, Uzi across his knees and head covered with a large white  skullcap, added: "Jericho is like Jerusalem. It has always been part of  biblical Israel and it always will be."
The faithful plunged into the study of the conquest of Jericho by the  Hebrews led by Joshuah after the flight from Egypt.
"We do not want any provocation or clashes with the Palestinian police,"  Porat said.
"But we consider it shameful that Israel has signed an agreement which  puts Palestinians in charge of a Jewish holy place. It's a dangerous precedent.
"We will never leave here. We will come to pray every day, then we we will  eat and sleep here. No one can wipe out the Jewish presence in Jericho."
He claimed negotiations were underway to let Jews live in the synagogue,  which boasts 5th-6th century mosaics and has recently been renovated with  money from an anonymous US donor.
In adjoining rooms, a dozen beds with ripped mattresses are lined up. A  basic kitchen has been set up and large pots hang on the walls.
"The Arabs may be having their way today with help from our defence  minsiter (Yitzhak Rabin), but tomorrow the wind will change and we will have  our revenge," said Waldman.
Outside, the Palestinian policemen chatted to Israeli officers and a joint  Palestinian-Israeli patrol passed close by with orange flags atop radio  aerials.
"If the Jews come here just to pray there will be no problem," said one of  the policemen from the Deir el-Balah refugee camp on the Gaza Strip.
Under the Israel-PLO self-rule deal signed on May 4 in Cairo, the house of  prayer is to be administered by the Palestinians in coordination with the  Israeli ministry for religious affairs.

The Cannes International Film Festival is  not an event one normally associates with crises.
Yet, with only a few days of the world's biggest film fest gone, two of  the films so far shown in competition have focussed on just that -- more  crises of ideological, cultural and ultimately international proportions.
Perhaps it is a coincidence. Perhaps the Russian and Taiwanese films  selected by the organizers of the 47th Film Festival just happened to have  strikingly common themes. Or perhaps it is the time in which we live.
Andrei Konchalovsky's "Kurochka Riaba" (Riaba My Chicken) tells of the  crisis faced by ordinary Russians trying to cope with the realities of the  switch to market economies.
Konchalovsky is quite open about the crisis he is describing in his tale  of Assia, whose life in a small village in the middle of Russia is overturned  by the discovery of a valuable golden egg.
After 70 years of communism, Russians simply do not know how to react to  the pressures which money and personal property bring with them. "Freedom  sometimes bears unexpected fruit," he says.
"Everyone thought that the end of communism, or totalitarianism was  fantastic ... the fall of the Berlin Wall and so on, it provided great hope."  But he added: "Then suddenly it isn't working."
Konchalovsky, who fled his own country for America and has only recently  returned, concedes there is no obvious solution to Russia's dilemma. "I have  no answers, only questions," he says.
The crisis referred to in Taiwanese filmmaker Edward Yang's "Du Li Shi  Dai" (A Confucian Confusion) is more subtle in its manifestations, but in some  ways more pervasive in its consequences.
The film tells the story of a group of 12 former schoolfriends living  hectic professional and romantic lives in Taipei -- but in various states of  dilemma about their relationship with their country's spiritual traditions.
As the title of the film suggests, these dilemmas remain largely  unresolved. And Yang argues that the cultural confusion he portrays is not  limited to Taiwan.
"I don't think its referring just to Taiwan, its referring to Hong Kong,  Korea, Japan and Singapore, all the Confucian-influenced societies," he said  in an interview with AFP.
"There's a dilemma whether you want to do more about your life or whether  you want to accept the intimidating pressure which puts you back in your  place," he said.
"The West hasn't really realized this culture change. Every one of these  states is trying to implement democracy."
In so many ways, these two films are worlds apart. But they nevertheless  have a strikingly common theme: the crisis created by the demise of a cultural  ideology in favour of western-style economic progress.
One could argue that the two filmmakers are describing two entirely  different situations: there is no comparison between the economies, cultures  or societies of downtown Taipei and rural Russia.
One could equally say that one film is talking about the breakdown of a  spiritual culture, the other of an ideological culture.
Yet, whatever their differences, there is no doubt that both films are  vivid documents of the time in which we live.

Abu Kifah was born in Jordan  but grew up dreaming of a homeland in Palestine that he knew only from the  stories he heard from his parents and grandparents.
Now he still cannot believe that like hundreds of other Palestinian police   who crossed into Jericho he has finally reached the land of his dreams.
"It was a dream. Until now we were not fully awake," he said.
"I can't really believe I am here. I heard so much about Palestine from  the old people."
More than 400 men of the new Palestinian police force crossed over from  Jordan this week for the transfer of power from Israel which took place Friday.
Hundreds of Jericho residents rushed out to meet the policemen who had  tears in their eyes as they were bused in.
They were cheered all the way into town by youths shouting "Allah u  Akbar," (God is great), and were welcomed by music bands, marches, and  ululating women.
"To my parents and grandparents, it was the most beautiful place on earth,  a blessed land, with rich soil and and all kinds of trees," said Abu Kifah.
For years he kept the dream alive in the military camps where he was  trained to fight and pursue the Palestinian struggle.
Now Abu Kifah, or Father of Struggle in Arabic, is part of a joint patrol  driving with Israeli soldiers along Jericho's highways.
"I am working within a framework. I take orders from my superiors, but  they (the Israelis) are still my enemy," Abu Kifah said, nodding his head  toward a jeep with four Israeli soldiers parked under a tree near him.
There seemed to be little fraternization between the two, but they had  nevertheless shared soft drinks and sandwiches earlier as they rested between  patrols.
"We sent over drinks to them, and they offered us food, but we don't talk  much with them."
Ihab Salem, born in Egypt, had never thought he would have the chance to  see the land of his parents' dreams.
His most recent images of the occupied territories had been coloured by  the Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, which broke out in the occupied  territories in December 1987.
When he heard his friends' dramatic tales of the battles in the  territories or watched them on television, Salem longed to be a hero or even a  martyr.
"I would have liked to be killed or injured, but luck was not on my side,"  he said.

It will be remembered as the week that saw  the final demise of white rule in Africa and the inauguration of one of the  continents's most famous sons as South Africa's first black president.
"Let freedom reign, God bless Africa!" were the words of Nelson Rolihlahla  Mandela as he assumed office in Pretoria Tuesday in front of an array of world  leaders on the scale not seen since the funeral of assassinated U.S. President  John Kennedy more than 30 years earlier.
It will also be remembered as a week that witnessed former enemies  embracing as South Africa experienced unparalleled scenes of reconciliation,  with almost 350 years of white hegemony finally laid to rest.
Mandela led the way in promoting the new spirit of reconciliation,  praising his predecessor and new deputy president, Frederik de Klerk, as a man  who had "carved a place in history" with his bold reforms that led to the end  of apartheid rule.
"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will  again experience the oppression of one by another," Mandela said after taking  the oath of office at the Union Buildings, the imposing seat of government  that for so long signalled white power.
The new president also took the salute from the white security force  generals who had only a few years ago been engaged in a bitter and often  bloody struggle against his African National Congress (ANC).
There was praise from every quarter for the 75-year-old Mandela, who has  travelled from rural poverty, through lawyer activist, guerrilla commander and  27 years in jail to be president of Africa's economic powerhouse.
Almost everybody, from crowned heads of state to millions of ordinary  citizens, seemed to glow in the warmth of the transition to democracy and the  relative peace with which it was accomplished.
In one of many scenes that would have been unthinkable only five years  ago, De Klerk and the chief of the defence force, General Georg Meiring, were  seen talking with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, long an enemy of apartheid South  Africa because of Cuba's military support of Angola.
Mandela's installation followed the ANC's sweeping victory in the April  26-29 election that saw the liberation movement garner 252 seats in the new  400-member national assembly.
The ANC will dominate the government of national unity that will hold  office until elections in 1999 under a final constitution to be negotiated in  the next five years.
But Mandela also moved to ensure that all the major parties in parliament  were represented in his cabinet, which was finalised Wednesday.
The powerful home affairs ministry was given to Mangosuthu Buthelezi,  leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which has been engaged  in a bloody and enduring conflict with the ANC that has killed more than  14,000 people since 1990.
The IFP was granted two other portfolios in the 27-member cabinet, while  De Klerk's National Party, which came second to the ANC in the election, was  allocated six, inlcuding the the key finance post.
Mandela's government will face tough challenges in attempting to meet the  enormous expectations of the mainly poor black majority, reassuring the  largely skilled and wealthy whites and keeping a lid on political violence --  particularily the threat from white extremists opposed to the new order.

The upbeat Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) wants  a coalition government even if it wins an absolute majority in a final round  of legislative voting on May 29, party leaders said Sunday.
"We would want to set up a coalition government because that would serve  the country better," said party head Gyula Horn, 61, who got up from his  sickbed for the first time Sunday to attend an HSP election committee session  after sustaining serious injuries in a car accident ten days ago.
His party won 32.9 percent of votes in a first round ballot on May 8.
But Horn, foreign minister in the last communist government until 1990,  also told the election committee that the socialists would govern on their own  if no other political force was ready to join them.
"We would rather rule alone than arrange new elections, because the  country could not bear the tension of a new vote," he said.
Pollsters say the HSP has a good chance of winning a parliamentary  majority in the second round.
And only the orthodox communist Labour Party, and the runner-up liberal  opposition Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), which won 19.4 percent in the  first round, have so far signalled their willingness to join a coalition.
The SZDSZ has its own candidate for the premiership, Gabor Kuncze, and  expressed opposition to Horn being nominated for the post.
The HSP said it would not discuss coalition possibilities before the  second round, Horn said after Sunday's meeting, adding that his party would  not accept preconditions from prospective coalition partners.
The HSP committee reiterated that a socialist-led government would support  the rights and aspirations of Hungarian ethnic minorities in neighbouring  countries, said Laszlo Kovacs, the party's foreign spokesman.

The Kuwaiti foreign ministry has urged people  travelling abroad to leave their maids at home saying they could be used as a  pretext to harm the country's reputation.
A ministry statement published in Kuwaiti newspapers Sunday said that  taking servants abroad would "bring trouble that undermines the image of  Kuwait."
There are more than 170,000 male and female servants currently working in  Kuwait, most of whom come from Asia.
The ministry's statement said: "The enemies of Kuwait abroad are waiting  for the chance to find mistakes and seduce the maids to harm Kuwait's  reputation by accusing Kuwaiti nationals of oppressing their maids and of  violating human rights laws."
In the past Kuwait has come under fire from human rights organisations for  alleged human rights abuses, especially since it was liberated from  Iraqi-occupation by a US-led coalition at the end of the Gulf war in February  1991.

UN inspectors left for North Korea Sunday after  Pyongyang said it had started a controversial replacement of reactor fuel  rods, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.
The agency had said the inspectors would not make the trip unless the  reclusive Stalinist state agreed to postpone the fuel rod replacement. But on  Saturday the agency said it was not clear if the process had begun and wanted  to see for itself.
A spokesman said the IAEA had decided to go ahead with the trip even  though its team of inspectors were unlikely to complete more than half the  work it wanted carried out at the Yongbyon site, 90 kilometers (56 miles)  north of Pyongyang.
The inspectors are expected in the North Korean capital on Tuesday.
On Saturday Pyongyang said in a statement carried by its mouthpiece Korean  Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo that the fuel rod replacement process  had begun without international inspectors present.
"Refuelling is taking place under the watch of the cameras installed by  the agency (IAEA)," a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said. "So there  are no grounds for concern about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for  another purpose."
IAEA spokesman David Kyd however warned that if refuelling had indeed  started, it would be a "grave violation" of agreements between the agency and  North Korea on inspections.
"If the reports (of the refuelling) turn out to be correct, the inspectors  will be immediately recalled to Vienna," he said Saturday. The inspectors  would cut short their visit if the refuelling operation had reached a  "critical stage" before their expected arrival, he said.
Experts said if seals on the reactor's fuel rods were broken it would be  impossible to determine whether plutonium had been diverted to a clandestine  nuclear weapons programme.
US Defence Secretary William Perry warned last month that during the  current change the North could extract enough weapons-grade plutonium to  manufacture "four or five bombs" in addition to the one or two the United  States believes it may already have.
During their scheduled eight-day stay in North Korea the inspectors will  carry out maintenance checks on IAEA monitoring equipment installed at the  experimental five-megawatt reactor, including replacing batteries and film.
Meanwhile in the South Korean capital Seoul, officials said they expected  new high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang, despite the North's  moves to start refuelling Yongbyon.
Officials, quoted by the press there Sunday, based their expectations on  two things -- the first that only in a third round of high-level talks would  the crucial question of regular and additional nuclear inspections be tackled.
The second, the unnamed officials said in interviews, was that fuel rod  replacement requires at least 15 days of reactor cooling, meaning that the  start announced by the North Saturday could be interpreted as preparation.
"If the IAEA inspectors arriving in North Korea Tuesday conduct  inspections as scheduled, a third round of high-level US-North Korea talks are  highly likely to be held," South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted one  official in Seoul as saying.
Though both Seoul and Washington interpret the North Korean statement as  saying preparations have started, if it is found to have begun replacing the  rods, then the United States will not hold the third round of talks, the  official said.
North Korea denies it has any nuclear weapons program, despite its threat  a year ago to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
A North Korean spokesman said Saturday that Pyongyang was "prepared to  store all the spent fuel under the strict surveillance of the IAEA and fully  allow the IAEA to measure it," when the dispute is settled between North Korea  and the United States.
Analysts in the South took the phraseology of the North Korean statement  as another sign that the United States and North Korea, in low-level talks  last week, had already reached an understanding that permission for monitoring  the spent rods dependend on the third session of talks.

Fighting between Rwandan rebels and government  forces intensified Sunday in several districts of Kigali and in towns across  the country, a UN spokesman in the capital said.
Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone from Nairobi, reported heavy clashes  between the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops in the eastern  and southeastern suburbs of Remera and Kicukiro.
Mortar shells also fell in the centre of the capital, he said.
Fighting between the Tutsi-led RPF and the Hutu-majority government side  was also raging in Ruhengeri, a northwest town still held by the regular army,  and at Nkumba further to the north, Kabia said. Clashes were also reported at  Bugesera, south of Kigali.
The RPF claimed on Friday it had seizwed control of half the country.
Kabia added that Dutch Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk arrived in the  capital Saturday on a short visit, inspecting the Amaharo stadium and the  Meridien hotel, two refugee centres.
Former French minister for humanitarian action Bernard Kouchner, who  called Saturday on the international community to help avert "genocide" in the  country, was still in Kigali Sunday, Kabia said.
Less than a year after a peace accord was signed by the rebels and the  government, a Rwanda was plunged back into a murderous ethnic war on April 7,  a day after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in what the  government said was a rocket attack on his plane.
Since then an estimated 200,000 Rwandans have been killed and around  500,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries.
Although the capital's streets are no longer littered with corpses,  observers say that civilians trapped there now face a war of attrition where  weapons, rather than political dialogue, will have the ultimate say.

General Romeo Dallaire, head of the UN assistance mission in Rwanda, said  the RPF, made up of soldiers trained in guerrilla warfare, realizes it stands  to lose too much in an all-out assault on Kigali and has thus adopted a tactic  of "isolation, harassment and infiltration."
He said that by progressively wearing down their ennemies, the rebels, who  control large chunks of the northern and eastern parts of the country, hope to  be able to tighten their stranglehold around Kigali by gaining ground from the  southeast before launching a final assault.
The RPF has been ransacking military bases, fighting for control of the  road leading to the capital's airport, and lobbing mortars on the city centre  where officials building are located.
But some of the mortars, either accidentally or intentionally, have fallen  on city streets or refugee centres, terrorising civilians already struggling  to survive on little water and food.
Meanwhile Dallaire is trying to broker a ceasefire among the warring  parties while the UN Security Council is to vote next week on sending UN  reinforcements to the war-ravaged country.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Right, Jose Ayala Lasso, who visited  Kigali last week, made an impassioned plea Friday for the world to end the  "unimaginable human tragedy" in Rwanda.
"The world must do something to halt this violence," Ayala said.

Alain Prost and Max Mosley, head of the ruling  International Automobile Federation, want to bury the hatchet and work  together to improve safety in Formula One.
Prost, who retired last year after winning his fourth world title, has  been critical of the FIA over the accidents which killed Ayrton Senna and  Roland Ratzenberger two weeks ago, and of their handling of F1 in general.
Mosley had qualified the Frenchman's allegations, that officialdom was not  concerned about safety, as "outrageous."
However, it was only the latest outbreak in hostilities since Mosley  threatened to deny Prost a licence for last season, after waspish comments the  Frenchman had made about top officials.
But on Sunday the two men had a 45-minute lunch together at Renault's  motorhome before the Monaco Grand Prix.
"There is a difficult situation difficile and we must try to resolve it,"  Prost said afterwards.
"Now that I'm out of F1, I can keep my distance. But my experience of 13  years in F1 and 20 years in motor racing, could bring a great deal. That's why  I met Max Mosley, to see how we could work together to improve things."
The FIA's British president welcomed Prost as an independent driver's  voice.
Current drivers -- plus the retired Austrian world champion Niki Lauda --  voted on Friday to re-form the Grand Prix Drivers Association, and elected  four representatives to discuss safety issues with the FIA.
Mosley said: "The fact that Alain is not a member of those representatives  is an advantage. It enables him to be more independent. We are going to find a  way to collaborate, I'm sure we'll manage it."

A shoot-out between Israeli  troops and Palestinian gunmen left four Gazans wounded on Sunday, Palestinian  sources said.
The army said only two Palestinians aboard a truck from which the attack  came were lightly wounded.
However according to doctors at Khan Yunes hospital, four people who  needed treatment for bullet wounds said they had been in a taxi when the  shooting started.
The attack took place near the settlement of Morag where the Islamic  Resistance Movement (HAMAS) claimed responsibility for seriously wounding an  Israeli truck driver last Thursday.
Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian who was playing backgammon in a  doorway on a Gaza City street on Saturday night after they came under fire  from unknown assailants.

Thousands of Kurds have fled repression in  Turkey and crossed the mountains into northern Iraq, aid organisations said  here Sunday.
Some 4,200 Turkish Kurds have crossed the border since the beginning of  March, at a rate of around 20 families each day. Most of them crossed in the  past four weeks, said Hannes Kempman from the German aid association HAD.
"Altogether we have counted 4,203 people so far," he told AFP.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN children's  organisation UNICEF met Saturday in the border town of Dahuk to launch an  action programme with other non-governmental organisations working in the area.
"We have decided to start supplying them with food, water sanitation and  medical care," said the head of the UNHCR operation in northern Iraq,  Francesco Ardisson. They would be treated as refugees.
Ardisson said it had not been decided where they would be sheltered, but  the UNHCR was going to try to find a place further from the border with Turkey.
Half are currently staying in the border towns of Zakho or Dohuk where  they have been housed in public buildings or rented houses, while the rest are  in Sheranesh, a village 20 kilometres (12 miles) northeast of Zakho.
Zinin Yunis, 30, who reached northern Iraq 15 days ago, said she left her  Turkish village near Ulludere "because the Turkish army bombed it several  times."
She left with her five-year-old son who lost his left eye while fleeing  through the mountains. "We were fired on by a helicopter," Yunis said.
Hassan Yilmaz, 34, who comes from a village close to Diyarbakir in the  southeast Anatolia region of Turkey, said he had decided to flee with his wife  and four children "because the Turkish army wanted us to fight against the  (Kurdistan Workers Party) PKK."
"Some of my friends who refused were already dead or in prison. Therefore  I preferred to flee."
The worst clashes between the PKK and the Turkish security forces have  been in the Kurdish-majority Anatolia area, where the PKK is fighting for an  independent state.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since an autonomous region  was established with the backing of the US-led coalition after the 1991 Gulf  war.

A British soldier was killed in Northern Ireland  overnight by a bomb blast near an army roadblock in an attack claimed by the  Irish Republican Army (IRA), police said Sunday.
The bomb exploded in the village of Keady, near the border with the Irish  Republic.
The soldier died shortly after being taken to hospital. Another soldier  was slightly wounded in the attack.
The IRA claimed responsibility in calls to local media.
The soldier was the 26th person to die in sectarian violence this year in  Northern Ireland.
In another incident, in west Belfast a mixed patrol of British troops and  police fired several plastic bullets at a group of youths throwing stones and  bottles at them.
Four soldiers were slightly hurt. Police did not report any civilian  casualties.

If you care about keeping your car in one  piece, don't feed the mountain parrots, the New Zealand Automobile Association  (AA) warns motorists travelling in alpine areas.
The parrots, or keas (nestor notobilis), have become a major tourist  attraction, but they become so keyed up by high-calorie human food that they  rip cars up, the AA's monthly magazine Directions reports in its latest issue.
"With a quick fuel-up of human food, the kea is all set as far as eating  goes and can spend the rest of the day investigating the multitude of  interesting things associated with helpful humans."
Under natural conditions a kea will spend its entire day looking for plant  and insect material.
The raucous, inquisitive 46-centimeter-long (18.4-inch-long) olive green  parrots can be "incredibly effective at causing damage," especially to cars,  the AA said.
"Their toys include boots, tents, packs, windscreen rubber seals, car  wiper blades, ski roof racks, car sunroof rubber surrounds, car aerials,  clothing, ski tower padding, wiring for lights ..." which they can rip with  their beaks.
The AA recommends that people parking cars in areas inhabited by keas keep  netting available to cover them.
The birds have been seen with their claws loosely hooked on steeply  sloping high tension cables, sliding down the wire at great speeds with  excited screeching, and then flying back up the hill for another go.
The keas' strength, their ability to move both parts of their beaks, their  versatile feet, harsh home environment and lack of natural enemies means they  are not afraid of people.
"All of this adds up to how a kea can be incredibly effective at causing  damage," the AA said.

Britain's governing Conservative Party excised  personal attacks on John Smith from its campaign guide for next month's  European elections after the opposition leader's sudden death, a newspaper  reported Sunday.
The weekly Observer revealed that several passages were removed from the  internal party guide, which had been drafted at the beginning of May.
These included charges that "Mr. Smith has failed to live up to his  promise" and had shown "ineffectual and visionless leadership" at the head of  the Labour Party.
The original document also claimed that his 18 months at the head of the  party "have managed to make (former Labour leader Neil) Kinnock look like a  first-rate leader."
A Conservative Party spokesman said only minor passages had been altered  following Smith's unexpected death from a massive heart attack Thursday.
But the Observer report drew stinging criticism from Labour chairman David  Blunkett.
He said the guide had advised Conservative candidates for the Euro-poll to  say "very personal and unpleasant things which had little to do with the  policy differences we have on Europe."
He added: "This personal abuse contrasts with what has happened over the  last three days," during which tributes for Smith have poured in from both  sides of the political spectrum -- including moving speeches from Prime  Minister John Major.
All major parties have declared a truce in campaigning for the June poll  until after Smith's funeral Friday.

A 19-year-old suspect was brought in for questioning  Sunday in connection with an outbreak of anti-foreign violence in the east  GErman town of Magdeburg, authorities said.
Magdeburg prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers did not disclose the identity of the  suspect but said in response to a question on whether the man was an  extremist: "He is not unknown to us."
The violence last Thursday involved gangs of skinheads who banded together  to hunt down foreigners, most of them Africans.
Around 50 youths, armed with sticks and knives, turned on a group of  Africans before launching a full-scale manhunt through the streets. According  to police up to 150 youths took part in the violence, in which three people  were reported injured.
One local television station, citing Magdeburg police chief Antonius  Stockmann, said that the leader of the violence has been identified through a  reliable witness and the prosecutor's office has asked that he be arrested and  charged.
Stockmann added that television footage of the violence has not allowed  authorities to identify other culprits.
Meanwhile one German man injured in the head during the rampage remained  in a coma Sunday.
German authorities have been heavily criticized for their handling of the  violence and public outrage increased after the local prosecutor's office  freed all but one of the 50 arrested, citing lack of evidence.
In response to the public outcry the Christian Democratic Union of  Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called an emergency meeting of the committee on  legislation in the lower house for Monday.
It is proposing that police be given powers to hold suspects in custody  for longer without pressing charges, and stiffer penalties for those convicted  of racist attacks.
But it could run into opposition from the Liberal FDP, which maintains  that existing legislation is sufficient so long as it is firmly implemented.
Meanwhile local Christian and Jewish organisations decided over the  weekend to set up their own citizens' watch groups to protect synagogues and  homes for asylum seekers.

Unidentified thieves robbed the Budapest office  of the U.S. Peace Corps educational and humanitarian organisation, state  Hungarian Radio said Sunday.
The robbers took a safe containing some 10,000 dollars as well as  Hungarian currency from the bureau after they shot out security cameras and  the alarm device above its entrance to be able to get in.
They made away with a car owned by Peace Corps, the radio said.
The robbery took place Thursday overnight. Police launched an  investigation.

More than one billion people will suffer from  hunger in the year 2030 because of the world's population rise, the head of  the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned here Sunday.
In a meeting with Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in the  northern city of Rasht, Jacques Diouf urged FAO member states to "cooperate  closely to provide nutritional security in poor countries," Tehran Radio said.
He warned that 1.1 billion people would go hunger in 2030.
Rafsanjani said Iran had worked hard since the 1979 Islamic revolution to  ensure that its population was well-fed, and he urged other developing  countries to do the same.
Diouf, who arrived here Thursday, was with Rafsanjani for the opening of a  rice research institute in Rasht. He also called for boosting cooperation with  Iran in agriculture.

New England boss Ray Illingworth warned England's  flops here on Sunday to start producing the goods -- or face the axe.
England's new chairman of selectors, after recalling Graham Gooch to the  fold, said: "The slate is clean and we start from here.
"But those people who have had a lot of opportunities won't get as many  chances as newcomers. They should start to produce in two or three matches if  they are going to."
Illingworth produced his broadside -- with Graeme Hick and Chris Lewis tow  of his likely targets -- while announcing a 13-strong squad for this week's  Texaco Trophy internationals against New Zealand.
He added: "We are going to want 100 percent commitment in concentration,  guts and determination. If we get that I think people will find I'm loyal in  return. If we don't, they won't play."
Former England skipper Gooch, who missed the winter tour to the West  Indies, was recalled after scoring a double hundred against Kent this week.
He got the nod after confirming he was ready to tour Australia next winter.
"You can't argue with his form," said the chairman. "Mike was quite happy  to have him in the squad and I should think he will bat at No 4."
Yorkshire fast bowler Darren Gough, 23, who toured with England A in the  winter, and Hampshire off-spinner Shaun Udal, 25, are both included in a  senior England squad for the first time.
Steve Rhodes, the wicketkeeper who played three Texaco matches in 1989 and  has been waiting for another opportunity ever since, is also included.
With Illingworth committed to playing a specialist behind the stumps in  all forms of cricket, Rhodes can put more heat on Jack Russell when he faces  the New Zealanders at Edgbaston on Thursday and at Lord's two days later.
But it's the likes of Hick, Lewis And DeFreitas who have most to gain --  or lose -- during the next few weeks.

Top women gymnasts are going to be getting older,  the sport's ruling body has decided, after raising the minumum age at major  competitons from 15 to 16 from 1997.
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) made the move at a weekend  congress here, where they also voted to abolish compulsory exercises from 1997.

Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) Sunday announced it  would give record compensation of 4.1 million Taiwan dollars (154,716 US) to  the families of Taiwan victims killed in a plane crash in central Japan.
"We have decided to compensate 4.1 million dollars to each of the families  of the victims killed in the crash, and the amount will be applied to the  relatives of both Japanese and Filippino victims," CAL spokesman Michael Lo  told reporters here.
Reports have said the relatives of Japanese victims are planning to file a  lawsuit in Japan seeking more than 47 million Taiwan dollars in compensation  each.
The crash at Nagoya Airport killed 264 of the 271 people onboard the CAL  Airbus 300-600R April 26.  Preliminary investigations have indicated that the  crash was due to a combination of pilot and mechanical error.
Of the victims, 101 were from Taiwan, 136 from Japan and the rest from the  Philippines.

Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was  beginning his US trip by meeting Sunday with the Indian community in New York.
Rao, who arrived in the Big Apple on Saturday on the first US tour by an  Indian premier since Rajiv Gandhi came here in 1987, was also to visit Houston  and Boston and give a lecture at Harvard before arriving in Washington  Wednesday.
The Indian prime minister's two-day stay in Washington will include a  speech to a joint session of congress, and a two- and-a-half-hour session with  President Bill Clinton.
The two men are scheduled to hold a joint press conference after their  meeting Thursday.
Rao, 73, is also scheduled to have talks with Defense Secretary William  Perry, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
The visit comes at a time of tension between the two countries over a  number of issues, notably India's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes,  Kashmir, human rights and trade.
US officials have said they hope the trip will bring better understanding  between the two sides, but they are not expecting it to result in any  breakthrough announcements.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to cap  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defence programme, and the  Washington trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in  office.
The carrot for Pakistan is the possibility of obtaining delivery of F-16  fighter planes it has already paid for but which were frozen by Congress -- a  prospect that angers India, which has fought three wars with Pakistan since  partition in 1947.
With India there is not such obvious quid pro quo, but there are areas in  which the United States could offer more help, such as science and technology  transfers, US officials say.

In any case, "the bottom line in all this is that you can't buy agreement  either from Pakistan or India on nuclear proliferation issues if they are not  persuaded that this is in their own best security interests," one said.
There has also been friction over Kashmir, with India feeling that the  administration of US President Bill Clinton favors Pakistan in the dispute and  has tacitly encouraged the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir.
Washington denies that Clinton has shifted policy on Kashmir, and says it  is a matter of Indian perception.
The US policy has always been the same -- that the Kashmir dispute is  something that India and Pakistan should work out between them, taking into  account the wishes of the Kashmir people, US officials say.
Rao made it clear this week that he was not about to cause further  ructions at home by making any major concessions on the nuclear  non-proliferation issue during his Washington trip.
Another key element of the visit is the effort to boost the economic  relationship, which has taken off with the opening up of the Indian economy in  the Rao administration.

Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and another  senior Thai government official have called on ASEAN member countries to  oppose western military aid to Phnom Penh, local dailies reported Sunday.
The comments by the prime minister came only days after the Cambodian  monarch, King Norodom Sihanouk, said foreign military assistance might be the  only way to end his government's continuing military conflict with the Khmer  Rouge.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) "is in a good position  to voice opposition to any foreign interference in Cambodia's internal  affairs," Chuan was quoted as saying in The Nation daily.
While ASEAN members have not agreed on a policy for military aid to  Thailand's eastern neighbor, Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said  the regional organization "still wants to see a political settlement and  national reconciliation within Cambodia," the Bangkok Post daily reported.
Last week, Australia, the United States and France began discussing the  possibility of sending weapons to support Phnom Penh's continuing struggle  with Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
Thailand has criticized the idea repeatedly, saying a renewed influx of  arms would result in a prolonging of the conflict, as well as widespread  gun-running and banditry.
But Chuan, quoted in The Nation, allowed that Cambodia had a "sovereign  right to ask for a foreign arms supply."
Phnom Penh has been invited to attend as an observer the July meeting of  ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phillipines, Singapore and  Thailand.

Hick, who played well in patches in the West Indies, still needs to  impress after failing to reproduce a glittering county career, while Lewis and  DeFreitas continue to be accused of unpredictable form despite their undoubted  talent.
Illingworth added: "We discussed four or five other seamers, another four  batsmen and three more slow bowlers.
"What we've settled for is a squad we think can win the one-dayers. It is  important for us to start winning matches because that will do everyone's  confidence some good.
"But these people are playing for their Test futures as well. All of them  can enhance their prospects."
Dermot Reeve is unlikely to make the Test squad but his batting and  medium-paced bowling, as well as his enthusisasm in the field, continue to be  key elements in England's one-day strategy.
Pace bowlers Devon Malcolm and Andy Caddick, however, look sure to return  to the front-line for the Test series.
England's 13-man squad for the two one-day internationals against New  Zealand at Edgbaston (May 19) and Lord's (May 21):
M A Atherton (Lancashire, capt), P A J DeFreitas (Derbyshire), A R C  Fraser (Middlesex), G A Gooch (Essex), D Gough (Yorkshire), G A Hick  (Worcestershire), C C Lewis (Nottinghamshire), D A Reeve (Warikshire), S J  Rhodes (Worcestershire), R A Smith (Hampshire), A J Stewart (Surrey), G P  Thorpe (Surrey), S D Udal (Hampshire).

The mother of former Afghan president  Najibullah was killed in a road accident here Sunday, police said.
Bibi Haleema, 70, who had been living here with her son-in-law, was hit by  a bus while she was crossing a road, according to the police.
Najibullah has been holed up in a UN building in Kabul since his overthrow  in April 1992.

Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads the  country's first minority government in 39 years, took to the rain-drenched  streets of Tokyo Sunday to seek public support for his policies.
"We face a lot of internal and external problems which need urgent  settlement," Hata told a crowd in front of Tokyo's Shinjuku railway station.
Hata, who came to power on April 28 after his predecessor Morihiro  Hosokawa resigned over a financial scandal, said his minority government  needed public support in order to survive offensives by opposition parties.
"It's certain my fragile administration will immediately collapse if the  opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion" against the cabinet in  parliament, he said.
The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the second largest  opposition group, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), have indicated they may  table a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet, possibly in June.
Hata stressed he was ready to compromise with the opposition over tax and  other policies, in order to solve a parliamentary deadlock.
"I will do my best for opposition parties, including the LDP and SDP," the  prime minister said.
Hata hopes to complete his sweeping tax reforms and market-opening  measures, designed to boost both domestic sales and imports, by the end of  June.
Ruling party politicians have indicated that a rise in the current  three-percent consumption tax on all goods and services might be inevitable  under the planned tax reforms, which include income and residence tax cuts.
Hata is to meet LDP president Yohei Kono and SDP chairman Tomiichi Muraya  on Monday, to seek their cooperation in managing parliamentary business.
The prime minister is expected to ask the two major opposition parties to  cooperate in passing the government's fiscal 1994 budget through parliament as  soon as possbile, observers said.
The government's 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 1994 expires on May  20.
Hata's power base weakened sharply when the SDP withdrew from the ruling  coalition just before he formed his cabinet.
Meanwhile Jiji Press news agency said Sunday that popular support for the  Hata cabinet stood at 40.9 percent earlier this month, 5.3 points lower than  public support given to Hosokawa shortly after he came to power last August.
The first Jiji poll on the Hata cabinet was taken across Japan on May  7-10, and canvasssed 1,400 eligible voters, aged 20 or above, before justice  minister Shigeto Nagano resigned over his controversial remarks on Japan's  past military action.
Nagano came under fire at home and abroad, saying that the 1937 Nanjing  massacre in China by Japanese troops was a fabrication and that Japan did not  wage a war of aggression during World War II.

The Monaco Grand Prix got off to a dramatic start  on Sunday, when Damon Hill's Williams-Renault shunted into the back of Mika  Hakkinen's McLaren-Peugeot, forcing both men out of the race.
The low-speed accident came within the opening seconds, when both men  headed into the first bend after race leader Michael Schumacher.
Drivers, officials and motorsport fans were praying for an accident-free  race on this relatively slow street circuit, following Karl Wendlinger's crash  here on Thursday which has left the Austrian in a deep coma.
The legendary race is also the first since Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger were killed at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Schumacher, out in front of the two Ferraris, has won all three previous  races this season.

Indonesia urgently needs to act on workers'  rights if it does not want a repetition of last month's worker demonstrations   that left one person dead, a human rights group said in a report released here  Monday.
"Reforms announced by the minister of manpower in January 1994 had, by  early May, had no visible effect on increasing freedom of association or  decreasing military involvement in labor disputes," Human Rights Watch/Asia  said in the report titled "Indonesia: The Medan Demonstrations and Beyond."
A week of labor demonstrations in Medan, and other towns in North Sumatra,  last month degenerated into violence that left one ethnic Chinese dead.
The military blamed the independent trade union SBSI, which has emerged as  a serious challenger to the government-controlled SPSI, for the violence,  while SBSI counter-charged that they were responsible for inciting the  violence and the anti-Chinese element.
Human Rights Watch called for a "full, impartial and independent  investigation" into the events in Medan, but in the longer term urged the  Indonesian government to "remove existing barriers to freedom of association,  allowing workers to organize freely."
This includes "ending military intervention in labor disputes, not just on  paper, but in practice," the report said.
Respect of labor rights are a condition for Jakarta's generalised system  of preferences (GSP) trade status with Washington under US law.
The United States in February suspended its continuous review of  Indonesian labor rights practices to give Jakarta time to take measures to  improve matters, but is to give an assessment of the situation in August.
The US authorities "should ensure that this assessment is rigorous and, if  possible, based on an on-site investigation," the report said.
"If it is found that worker rights have not improved significantly" since  February, Indonesia's GSP should be revoked, it added.

An Iranian religious organisation urged all Moslems  making the pilgrimage in Mecca to defy a Saudi ban and take part in an anti-US  rally planned by Iranians pilgrims, the official news agency IRNA said Sunday.
"We call on all pilgrims, especially politically-aware Iranians, to take  part in the demonstration as in previous years to foil the plots of the  enemies of Islam," the Islamic Propagation Organisation said, quoted by IRNA.
The Mecca gathering is the "best opportunity and Mecca the best place for  Moslems to express their hatred of the infidels, notably the United States and  Israel," it added.
The head of the Iranian pilgrimage delegation, Mohammad Mohammadi  Reyshahri, told a group of pilgrims Saturday that holding the rally was a  "religious must" and urged everyone to participate on Tuesday.
The anti-US and anti-Israel demonstrations are "aimed at fostering Islamic  unity and enlightening the ummah (Moslems) about the dangers from  non-believers," he said.
Reyshahri however urged the pilgrims to be "disciplined and peaceful" to  avoid any "unseemly incidents."
Saudi authorities warned last week they would not allow Iranian pilgrims  to carry out their planned demonstration.
IRNA said Saturday the Saudi riot police had taken up positions around the  Iranian pilgrims camps in Mecca to prevent the rally from being held.
Police were deployed on both sides of the entrance to the camp, while  about 10 police cars and armoured vehicles were stationed in the streets  opposite, the agency said.
It also charged that two cameras, placed on the roofs of two tall  buildings across the street, were filming all movements to and from the camp  around the clock.
Similar demonstrations have triggered clashes with Saudi police in  previous years, the most violent being in 1987, when 400 pilgrims, including  275 Iranians, were killed. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were  broken off for three years afterwards.
The annual Moslem pilgrimage this year is to start on May 19 in Mecca, the  birth place of the prophet Mohammad and Islam's holiest shrine.

Some 400 Libyan Moslems have arrived  on camel-back in Tabuk, northwest Saudi Arabia, for the annual pilgrimage to  Mecca, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference said here Sunday.
The caravan of 350 camels was welcomed at the Saudi border by Tabuk  leaders who helped to arrange the trip.
The pilgrims decided to travel to Islam's holiest sites by camel to  protest the UN air embargo on Libya imposed in April 1992 after Tripoli  refused to hand over suspects in bombings of US and French airliners that  killed 440 people.
They left Libya in April and crossed through Egypt and Jordan before  arriving in Saudi Arabia. From Tabuk, they left for Medina and Mecca, again by  camel.
Almost one million pilgrims from across the world have already arrived in  Mecca for the pilgrimage, the highpoint of which will be on Friday when they  climb Mount Arafat, the official Saudi agency SPA said Sunday.
Last year more than two million people took part in the pilgrimage.

Shortly before the start drivers had paid homage to Senna, the triple  world champion whose death has tended to overshadow that of rookie  Ratzenberger.
Gathered together at the front of the grid, where the first two places had  been left clear out of respect to the dead drivers, they made way for  Brazilians Christian Fittipaldi and Rubens Barichello, along with  Ratzenberger's German teammate Heinz Harald Frentzen, who all moved forward  with a Brazilian flag bearing the words "adeus Ayrton".

Cannes festival-goers received a sobering  reminder of the world beyong the glitz of the Croisette Sunday, when the  horrors of war in Bosnia were brought to the Festival Palace.
"Bosna!" by French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, pulls no punches in its  use of amateur video and audio material to depict the last two-and-a-half  years in the war-torn ex-Yugoslav republic.
The documentary includes a good deal of footage which would clearly have  been censored on television, and is accompanied by an unashamedly polemical  commentary by Levy.
But Levy, a high-profile campaigner for intervention to halt Serb  aggression in ex-Yugoslavia since early on in the war, staunchly defends his  right to bring such shocking images to the world's biggest filmfest.
"The Bosnians filmed everything, one must know that ... It is like a book  of the dead ... Open the book they told us. You would rather look away? Look  somewhere else? What a a mistake. The images were made for you.
"If the West seen them, it will be as thought they are opening the death  pits with us -- it will be as though they are helping put a face back on the  dead, giving them the identity they have lost."
At one point Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is seen looking down the  barrel of guns firing from the hills around Sarajevo, shaking hands with local  military commanders.
In another scene his military commander General Ratko Mladic is heard  laughing while delivering orders by radio for snipers to begin shooting on  refugees fleeing part of the town.
One of the most harrowing scenes in the two-hour documentary shows a truck  being ambushed on Sarajevo's Sniper's Alley, a main avenue. As its driver runs  for cover of neighbouring buildings, snipers began taking pot shots at him.
The sequence does not end with the driver safe and sound. The camera  focuses in as the man is shot once, then again, then again, his face a vision  of panic and agony.
The documentary, appearing in the "Un Certain Regard" section of the  festival, is strongly critical of western inaction in Bosnia, in particular  attacking French President Francois Mitterrand.
Initial reaction after the preview screening of the film was largely  positive. "It is shocking, but I think it had to be made," said one critic  emerging on to the Croisette.
Levy's justification for his film, which receives its public premiere  Sunday evening, is simple. "Do not hide anything. You owe it to the dead. You  owe it to the survivors," he says.
Director Alain Ferrari, asked whether the film could be termed a  documentary given its clear political slant, replied: "I believe in points of  view, so long as they are documented of course.
"I believe in films that say "I," that say "us." I believe in committed  films."

The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fronting the  armed insurgency against Turkish authorities is on the point of breaking up  after a series of military defeats, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said here  Sunday.
Mentese said in a statement that the PKK "has lost its options for  logistical support and suffered major losses following large-scale operations  by the army."
He added: "The process of dissolution of the separatistist organisation  has begun."
Since May 1, Mentese said, 314 PKK militants had been arrested and 186  killed, and 48 others including senior commanders had surrended to security  forces in the Kurdish strongholds of east and southeast Turkey, where the PKK  is fighting for an independent state.
He repeated earlier government pledges that the PKK would be eliminated by  the end of the year, urging militants to give themselves up to benefit from  sentence reductions offered to Kurdish activists who have taken no part in the  armed struggle.
Separately, authorities in Diyarbakir, the headquarters of the  government's military operation against the insurgents, said Sunday that 16  Kurdish rebels were killed Saturday in clashes with government forces in  southeast Turkey.
The deaths raised to 31 the number of Kurdish fighters killed since Friday.
Earlier Sunday in Zakho, Iraq, aid organisations said thousands of Kurds  had fled repression in Turkey and crossed the mountains into neighbouring Iraq.
Some 4,200 Turkish Kurds have crossed the border into northern Iraq since  the beginning of March, with most having crossed in the past four weeks, said  Hannes Kempman from the German aid association HAD.
Since the Turkish Kurd insurgency was launched in August 1984, more than  11,000 rebels, police, troops and civilians have been killed.

Israeli Prime Minister Izthak Rabin is calling for  Europeans to underpin the Midle East peace process by strengthening economic  cooperation between Israel and the European Union.
In an interview released Sunday in advance of publication Monday in  Germany's Die Welt, Rabin said Israel was not asking for favours or European  aid but wanted a European market which was open to trade with the Jewish state.
Rabin stressed Israel was not asking for EU membership but said: "we  cannot tolerate the discrimination of the European Union." He said the arrival  of peace in the Middle East ought to bring "economic advantages" to Israel,  pointing out that his country posted a 4.5 billion-dollar deficit with EU  states last year.
Rabin asked EU members to remove what his government sees as unfair  competition legislation and afford Israeli products fair access to EU markets,  saying this already happened it the case of the United States.
Rabin said each billion dollars' worth of exports meant the creation of  some 15-20,000 jobs in Israel.
On the question of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967 and  annexed in 1981, Rabin said he was willing to put the issue of withdrawal to  the Israeli people in a referendum but only once a "valid accord with Syria  has been negotiated." Syria is demanding the heights be returned before it  will consider a peace agreement with Israel.

A "surprise" included in the schedule of  the 47th Cannes International Film Festival is by leading South Korean  director Shin, Sang Okk, reliable sources said Sunday.
The director, who is on the jury judging the main competition of the  festival, will see have his latest film "Vanished" screened at a special  projection here on Tuesday night.
The movie is not in competition at the festival, which opened last  Thursday and is due to end next Monday.
It will not be the first time that the surprise selection is by a member  of the festival jury. In 1979 Francoise Sagan, president of the jury that  year, saw her film "The Blue Ferns" screened.
Okk, long seen as one of South Korea's most prolific directors, was held  captive for some years in North Korea before fleeing to the United States in  1986.

The UN food agency said Sunday the influx of  Rwandan refugees into Tanzania, already hosting more than 320,000 other  Rwandans, was continuing unabated with an estimated 1,400 people arriving  daily.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said in a statement released here that  although it had managed to deliver adequate food to northwestern Tanzania, the  refugees were threatened with an outbreak of epidemics because of poor  sanitation.
The agency estimates that 100 tonnes of human excrement is piling up daily  in Benaco, the world's largest refugees camp. The faeces flow down the hill  when it rains and contaminates the only source of water for the refugees.
Relief workers, including those from the Red Cross and Medecins Sans  Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) are working round the clock to improve  sanitation in the refugee camps, WFP said.
Impassable roads, lack of transport and storage facilities have continued  to hamper relief deliveries to the refugees fleeing tribal massacres in  Rwanda, where more that 200,000 people have been killed in five weeks of  ethnic bloodletting pitting the majority Hutus against the minority Tutsi.
Another 500,000 have fled to neighbouring countries.
Fighting between the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels and  Hutu-dominated government forces intensified Sunday in the Rwandan capital,  Kigali and in several other towns across the country, a UN spokesman said.
The violence erupted after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed  in an alleged rocket attack on his plane over Kigali on April 6.
Food requirement for the refugees at Benaco camp is 4,600 tonnes a month  at an estimated cost of one million dollars, the WFP says.

Switzerland's Tony Rominger created history here on  Sunday by clinching a hat-trick of Tour of Spain triumphs.
The 1992 and 1993 winner also gave world number one Miguel Indurain the  perfect reminder that this year's Tour de France will be a major confrontation  between the two.
The 165km 21st and final stage between Palazuelos and Madrid was won in a  sprint finish by Frenchman Laurent Jalabert.
Rominger led the event from the first day after winning the opening time  trial. Spaniards Mikel Zarrabeitia and Pedro Delgado came third overall.
It was Jalabert's seventh stage win of the race.

Most of Egypt's 180,000 lawyers went on strike  Sunday to protest the death of a jailed lawyer who was allegedly tortured.
Abdel Hareth Madani died the day after being arrested on April 26 on  charges that he had acted as a go-between for imprisoned members of the  Islamic militant group Jamaa Islamiyya group and those abroad.
The Egyptian lawyers, who normally work on Sundays, also plan a protest  march on a palace of President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday.
They have demanded the release of 34 lawyers held without charge and to  take part in an inquiry into Madani's death.
The prosecutor's office said Thursday that an initial autopsy showed the  lawyer had died after being tortured.
But the interior ministry said two days later that Madani had died from an  asthma attack before even being questioned.
It said his asthma attack had started at his home where he had been taken  by security services and that Madani was immediately brought to hospital where  he later died.
But his family was only told of his death on May 6.
The ministry said Madani had been a "terrorist leader" of Jamaa, which has  waged a two-year-long campaign of violence against the government, and that it  had documents to prove the allegation.
Mukhtar Nuh, a member of the bar association, rejected the explanation  that Madani had died of natural causes, saying if that were true "the security  services would not have waited nine days to inform his family."
"Even if he was accused of belonging to an armed group, that doesn't give  the state the right to kill him," added Nuh, whose association is dominated by  the Moslem Brotherhood.

American Pete Sampras, warming up for the French  Open, gave his rivals an early fright by crushing Boris Becker in the Italian  Open final here on Sunday.
The world number one continued his extraordinary run of success by  thrashing the German in straight sets, winnning 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, at the Foro  Italico.
The victory also proved he has at last come to terms with clay courts --  just in time for the start of the Grand Slam event at Roland Garros in eight  days time.
Sampras, who has won the last three Grand Slams at Wimbledon, the US and  the Australian Open, said: "I feel confident going into the French Open, I  feel good about my tennis.
"I don't know if I can win it this year, but in a year, five years or ten,  I'd love to take that title."
It was his second clay-court success of his career after winning at  Kitzbuhel, Austria, in 1992. More importantly, however, it was his seventh  title this season and the fifth in a row in only nine outings, picking up 1.5  million dollars on the way.
He was last beaten by Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands in the first round  at Philadelphia in February, since when he has won 27 matches in a row.
Becker's defeat deprived him of his first career success on the surface.
Ranked 13th in the world, he never got into the match, taking over  half-an-hour to take his first game before Sampras won the first set in 35  minutes.
The American 22-year-old broke Becker immediately in the next to continue  the trend, playing patiently from the baseline until he clinched the event  with his second match point.
Becker refused to be downhearted, however, saying: "When I came here this  week I never thought that I had a chance to reach the final. This has been one  of my best weeks on clay."

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived  here Sunday at the start of his second shuttle mission in a fortnight between  arch-foes Syria and Israel.
Christopher was greeted at the airport by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shara who immediately accompanied him to the presidential palace for talks  with President Hafez al-Assad.
The secretary of state is expected to deliver a reply to Syrian  counter-proposals since an Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal from the  strategic Golan Heights.
He will fly to Israel on Monday and US embassy sources here expect  Christopher to return to Damascus before leaving the region on Thursday.
The official press reiterated Sunday that Syria insisted on a full Israeli  withdrawal from the heights. A total withdrawal was a condition for  negotiating with Israel on an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe, Tishrin  said.
In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said Christopher would try to  persuade Syria to set up a joint military commission with Israel that would  draft "security arrangements" for the Golan.
The heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed  in 1981, has been the cornerstone of the dispute between Israel and Syria.
In early May, Israel proposed to return three of five Druze villages on  the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over a period of five  to eight years.
The United States, as chief sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has  focused on narrowing the gap between the arch-enemies, following the signing  of the May 4 Israeli-PLO accord on the launch of Palestinian self-rule.

Four Buddhist monks imprisoned for joining a protest  march in Vietnman have been on a hunger strike for three weeks to denounce  their punishment, the Buddhist church to which they belong said in Paris  Sunday.
The four monks were convicted in January of "disturbing the public order"  and sentenced to up to four years in prison after they joined a demonstration  in the former imperial capital of Hue, south of Hanoi, organised by the  Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnman, an offshoot of the Buddhist Church of  Vietnman  which was set up in 1981 by the communist regime.
The monks, who are being fed intravenously, are asking that their prison  conditions be improved and that they be allowed to appeal their conviction as  allowed by law, the church said in a statement.
The church has also asked the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to  intervene and has appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross to  send a delegation to visit the monks.
The two Buddhist churches in Vietnman have been fighting for supremacy  among the country's 50 million Buddhists, who make up 60 percent of the  population.

Steffi Graf retained her German Open title -- her  eighth in nine years -- with a 7-6 (8/6) 6-4 victory over Brenda Schultz here  on Sunday.
It was Graf's 20th consecutive final since March 1993, and her 16th  victory -- and ample warning to her rivals a week before the French Open.
For Schultz it was the biggest final of her career, and her serve, the  fastest in women's tennis, forced several errors from Graf.
But the world number one seed was quicker around court and made less  unforced errors.
She failed to break, however, during the first set, with Schultz having  the best chance at 3-3 when she took Graf to deuce.
A backhand in the net and a wide return let Graf off the hook that time  before Schultz survived a similar scare at 6-5 with an ace to take early  control in the following tiebreak.
The Dutch girl's 3-0 lead was pegged back to 4-4 before Schultz missed a  set point at 6-5 by netting a backhand.
That gave Graf the chance to produce a perfect backhand return down the  line to take the set and she broke for a 2-1 lead in the second, a lead she  never lost.
Graf received a cheque for 150,000 dollars, and 11th seeded Schultz  receiving 60,000 dollars.

Senate leaders from both sides of the political  spectrum said Sunday they favored economic sanctions to force North Korea to  allow international monitoring of its nuclear program.
"I do favor sanctions against North Korea, and I believe we should make a  very determined effort to get our allies and countries in the region to join  us in these sanctions," said Senate majority leader George Mitchell, a  Democrat from Maine.
Republican Senate leader, Robert Dole of Kansas, said he hoped a way could  still be found to resolve the problem, but "faling that, I think sanctions  should be imposed."
Both senators said Washington should go ahead with sanctions despite North  Korea's threat that it would consider such action a declaration of war.
Dole said it was very important that Washington had the support of China,  which has a UN Security Council veto, in imposing sanctions on Pyongyang.
"There are a lot of foreign policy problems around the world, but this is  the most serious," Dole said of the year-old refusal by North Korea to allow  international inspections of its nuclear program, amid fears it is developing  or has developed a nuclear bomb.
"I think this is much more important than some human rights debate in  China that we want to make the human rights policy better," he added.
He was referring to President Bill Clinton's decision to link China's  privileged trading status with China with an improvement in its human rights  record.
Clinton has to make a decision by June 3, but Dole said the president  should acknowledge he had made a mistake in linking the two and drop the idea.
The North Korea issue "could lead to an international conflict and I think  it's very important to try to bring China on board," Dole said.
UN inspectors left Vienna for North Korea Sunday after Pyongyang said it  had started a controversial replacement of reactor fuel rods, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.
The agency had said the inspectors would not make the trip unless the  reclusive Stalinist state agreed to postpone the fuel rod replacement.
IAEA spokesman David Kyd warned that if refuelling had indeed started, it  would be a grave violation of agreements between the agency and North Korea.

Germany's Michael Schumacher swept to his fourth  victory of the Formula One season here on Sunday in a Monaco Grand Prix which  was won and lost within the opening seconds.
Schumacher, who has won every race this year, came home clear of Britain's  Martin Brundle in the McLaren-Peugeot and Austrian veteran Gerhard Berger in  the Ferrari.
The race, still overshadowed by Formula One's recent tragedies, made a  dramatic start when Damon Hill's Williams-Renault shunted into the back of the  other McLaren, driven by Mika Hakkinen, forcing both men out.
The low-speed accident came just after the green light as both men plunged  into the first bend after Schumacher in the Benetton-Ford.
Drivers, officials and motorsport fans had been praying for an  accident-free race on this relatively slow street circuit, following Karl  Wendlinger's crash here on Thursday which has left the Austrian in a deep coma.
The legendary race is also the first since Hill's teammate Ayrton Senna  and Roland Ratzenberger were killed in crashes at the San Marino Grand Prix  two weeks ago.
Schumacher, now almost certain to win this year's world championship, led  from start to finish while the two Ferraris of Berger and Jean Alesi scrapped  with Christian Fittipaldi in the Footwork-Ford in the early stages.
With so few opportunities to overtake on the winding streets of the  Principality, the places tended to change only with pit-stops for refuelling  or a retirement with mechanical problems.
Among those challengers to fall by the wayside were Britain's Mark  Blundell in the Tyrell-Yamaha and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello in the Jordan  Hart.
Blundell's bad lack was also shared by Berger, whose car spun round after  hitting a patch of oil left by the blown engine on the Englishman's Tyrell,  costing him a second place.
By the halfway stage, Schumacher was half a minute clear of Brundle, with  Berger third and Alesi fourth. Fittipaldi's charge ended with two thirds of  the race gone when he retired, thereby bringing Barrichello's Italian teammate  Andrea de Cesaris into the fray.
---
De Cesaris then took full advantage of a near-20sec pitstop for Alesi, who  needed the nose cone changed on his Ferrari after a minor crunch. Despite the  Frenchman's best efforts, he failed to dislodge the Italian and lost 10  seconds in the final half a dozen laps.
Schumacher's face was wreathed in smiles after the race, but there was  also reason for satisfaction for Brundle and Berger.
The Englishman had brought McLaren-Peugeot another podium finish in their  debut season, after Hakkinen's third place at San Marino, while Berger moved  into second place in the drivers' world championship.
Shortly before the start drivers had paid homage to Senna, the triple  world champion whose death has tended to overshadow that of rookie  Ratzenberger.
The first two places had already been left clear of cars, out of respect  to the dead men. But the drivers gathered together there before making way for  the trio of Brazilians Fittipaldi and Barichello, plus Ratzenberger's teammate  Heinz Harald Frentzen, who moved forward with a Brazilian flag bearing the  words "adeus Ayrton".
The recent accidents have prompted the re-formation of the Grand Prix  Drivers Association, and a raft of new safety measures from the ruling  International Automobile Federation to be introduced over the coming races.

But Indurain, just one week before the Tour of Italy, refused to give  Rominger a psychological edge by immediately responding in kind, winning the  Tour de l'Oise at Senlis in France.
He wrapped up the four-stage event by winning a final 12km time trial,  averaging 47.937km to edge out Frenchman Eddy Seigneur by 5secs and Britain's  Chris Boardman, the former world one hour record holder, by 12.

England have called up Warren Barton, Wimbledon's  uncapped right back, for their friendly against Greece on Tuesday, after  Manchester United's Paul Parker was ruled out by an ankle injury.
Barton, 25, has proved to be a solid defender, helping the unfashionable  south London side to finish sixth in the Premiership.
He will be an understudy for Liverpool's Rob Jones for the Wembley  double-header against World Cup finalists Greece and Norway next Sunday.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher went  straight into talks with President Hafez al-Assad here Sunday at the start of  his second peace shuttle in as many weeks between arch-foes Syria and Israel.
The secretary was to deliver Israel's response to Assad's  counter-proposals, following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal  from the strategic Golan Heights.
The Syrian president had asked for clarifications.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five to eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
State-run Damascus Radio said Christopher would find in Syria a readiness  to "negotiate seriously on ideas and proposals" which could lead to a  settlement, in contrast to Israel which was "squandering peace opportunities."
Syria is willing to discuss an Israeli withdrawal from the heights on  condition Israel pledges a complete pullout within an "acceptable and  reasonable" timeframe, the government daily Tishrin said.
A Tishrin commentary headlined "Will Israel take the adequate decision?"  said the ball lay in Israel's court "and those who give it support," in  reference to the United States.
In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said Christopher would try to  persuade Syria to set up a joint military commission with Israel to "draft  security arrangements" for the heights.
But the proposal was likely to be flatly rejected in Damascus, where an  official said only last week that Israel should complete a total pullout from  the heights before security arrangements could be discussed.
Syria has insisted it would not surrender a single inch of the plateau  which commands access to Damascus as well as northern Israel, but it has not  refused to discuss ways of finding a settlement.
Diplomats here and in Beirut said that the exchange of messages between  Syria and Israel was a step in the right direction, although both sides were  far from a breakthrough.
A Western diplomat in Damascus said the counter-proposals submitted to  Israel by Syria "included some very specific questions which opened the way  for a concrete and serious debate."
The official Syria Times newspaper, meanwhile, urged the United States to  play a full partner role in the peace process, and not just that of a postman  delivering messages.
Progress depended on "Washington playing its full partner role ... This  role should be effective and not ink on paper," the newspaper said.
Syrian demands for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, which the Jewish  state annexed in 1981, has been a major stumbling block in the peace process  launched back in October 1991.
Christopher himself has said he did not expect any major breakthrough on  his latest mission, following a similar shuttle in late April-early May, and  warned that a Syrian-Israeli peace deal was still a long way off.
"I do think the parties are serious and I want to play my part and take  messages back and forth," he said.

The mainly Moslem northeastern  Bosnian industrial town of Tuzla entered its third year of conflict Sunday  with UN reports describing the situation on nearby fronts as "very tense."
Life still showed no signs of returning to normal for the town's 200,000  residents after bombardments which killed two people and seriously injured  four more last Wednesday continued.
Another shell smashed into the beleaguered city's outskirts Saturday  afternoon and sirens warning people of further attack could be heard across  Sunday.
Local authorities meanwhile prepared to hold a ceremony to mark the second  anniversary of the conflict, which broke out here exactly two years ago.
Despite the unrest, the town is currently playing host to the final phase  of Bosnia's basketball championships, a tournament which will decide who  represents the nation in international competition next season.
The UN Protection Force spokesman for the north-east sector of the  conflict, Captain Jens Kirk, told AFP that 196 shells crashed down Saturday in  the nearby Vares sector, controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government  army.
Kirk added that, early morning Sunday, a further eight shells had been  fired at Vares, some 45 kilometres (27 miles) south of Tuzla. Vares straddles  a maze of routes linking northeast Bosnia to Sarajevo and the Dalmatian coast.
A further 100 shells rained down Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of  Tuzla, and a UN armoured patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms  fire on both Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said. "Three bullets pierced the  vehicle, but no-one was wounded."
Bosnian government forces managed over the weekend to take control of Serb  positions at Vijenac hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla, "from where some  of the shells hitting our villages and Tuzla had been fired," Bosnian Colonel  Ekrem Advic, head of the press servic of the Bosnian army's Second Corps told  AFP.
The capture by the Bosnian army of "some 10 square kilometres" (four  square miles) of land in the sector was confirmed by sources close to the UN  Protection Force, who linked the Bosnian offensive and the shelling of Tuzla  Wednesday.
The six mortar shells fired on the town then in two waves -- four on the  old town in the late morning and two in the eary evening on the main  residential quarter -- led the authorities to close schools and markets.
Despite that precautionary move, some traders, including grocers and  cigarette-vendors, took their merchandise to the main market Sunday. Cafes,  too, were open to receive a flood of customers determined to enjoy one of the  first warm days of spring.
The ceremony organised by civil and military authorities to mark the two  years of conflict was meanwhile set to go ahead as planned, but indoors.
Several hundred people were killed in the clashes when the fighting  erupted in Tuzla on May 15, 1992, six weeks after the conflict enveloped the  Bosnian capital Sarajevo. Sources said those early clashes resulted from an  attempt to ambush Yugoslav federal army units threatening to take control the  town.

Two British airlines Sunday cancelled flights to  Paris' Orly airport, averting a showdown over landing rights after France  agreed to open the airport to services from London by the end of June.
In a joint statement, French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and his  British counterpart John MacGregor said they were committed to opening the  Orly-London link to air traffic "as soon as possible and at the latest by the  end of June."
Spokesmen for British Airways (BA) and Air UK told AFP their companies had  decided to cancel inaugural London-Orly services that had been planned for  Monday in defiance of a landing ban by French authorities.
But background tensions remained as a bullish BA pledged to press for a  start date to services earlier than the ministries' deadline, amid reports  that France might appeal against the form of a European Commission ruling  which sparked the dispute by ordering the route to be opened to competition.
The airline spokesmen said the scheduled flights, out of London's Heathrow  and Stansted airports respectively, would still go ahead but would be rerouted  to Paris's northern Charles de Gaulle-Roissy airport.
Until now all London-Paris flights have landed at Charles de Gaulle.
A spokesman for the Paris ministry said London had agreed to ensure that  BA, its TAT subsidiary, and Air UK cancelled the planned flights into Orly,  south of Paris, Monday.
BA chairman Colin Marshall said in a statement: "Our objective ... was to  secure our right to fly to Orly and we have done that. We are pleased that the  French government is now committed to not interfering with the implementation  of the European Commission decision."
He said BA was "prepared to defer the start of our services for a short  time."
But he added that he was confident outstanding problems could be resolved  before the end of June, and warned that the company would press the British  government "for the earliest possible date for the start of services."
Air UK managing director Andrew Gray said the company now looked forward to  "the opportunity to ... use our slots and fulfill our objectives to serve  Paris Orly."
The ministries' statement said that, on the French side, outstanding  "safety, environmental and congestion problems" would be resolved in line with  existing EU regulations, while problems faced by French carriers in gaining  landing slots at British airports, particularly Heathrow, would be examined.
But neither airline mentioned problems facing their French competitors  over landing rights at Heathrow.
The British carriers had planned to land up to 10 airliners at Orly Monday  in breach of the French ban after insisting with British government backing  that they were entitled to start services in line with the commission ruling  last month.
But French authorities continued to bar British flights to the airport in  defiance of the decision, which ordered France to open three routes --  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles -- to competition.
Bosson aides said Sunday that France still intended to appeal against the  opening of the Toulouse and Marseilles routes, while the government reserved  the right to appeal against the legal formulation of the commission's ruling  on the London link, rather than the decision itself.
BA had threatened Friday to sue the French government if it stopped the  company's flights, while French aviation authorities were reported ready to  reject the British carriers' flight plans, which would make it illegal for  them to take off from London.
Bosson had earlier cited congestion at Orly, environmental considerations  and increased access to London's Heathrow airport for French carriers as  issues which needed to be resolved before the route is opened.
Paris' southern airport represents a key market for foreign carriers,  which have to date only been authorised to ply the Orly-Nice route.
But national carrier Air France, which lost almost 8.5 billion francs  (1.45 billion dollars) last year, fears dire financial consequences if Orly is  opened too swiftly to its competitors.

A British soldier was killed in Northern Ireland  overnight by a bomb blast near an army roadblock in an attack claimed by the  Irish Republican Army (IRA), police said Sunday.
The bomb exploded in the village of Keady, near the border with the Irish  Republic.
The soldier died shortly after being taken to hospital. Another soldier  was slightly wounded in the attack.
The IRA claimed responsibility in calls to local media.
The soldier was the 26th person to die in sectarian violence this year in  Northern Ireland.
In another incident, in west Belfast a mixed patrol of British troops and  police fired several plastic bullets at a group of youths throwing stones and  bottles at them.
Four soldiers were slightly hurt. Police did not report any civilian  casualties.
Police also reported that loyalist gunmen began shooting Sunday as about  500 republican nationalists demonstrated in central Belfast but the incident  did not cause any injuries.
Authorities said that the demonstrators, marching to commemorate the 1981  death in prison of IRA hunger strikers, were heading towards the City Hall  when the shooting began as they were passing near the Protestant neighborhood  of Shankill.
The Ulster Freedom Fighters later claimed in a communique that two of its  members were responsible for the shooting.

Heavy fighting in Kigali, Rwanda's embattled  capital, prevented a UN plane carrying relief supplies from landing on Sunday,  a UN spokesman said.
But the plane, which was forced to return to Nairobi, went back to Kigali  during a lull in the fighting on Sunday afternoon and and delivered food and  medicines for displaced people and UN soldiers in the city, the spokesman,  Abdul Kabia, told AFP by phone from Kigali.
Normally the United Nations flies to Kigali twice daily but made only one  flight on Sunday because of intensified fighting between Tutsi-led Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels and Hutu-dominated government forces.
Sporadic fighting continued to rage in Kigali, Ruhengeri in the northwest,  and Nkumba further to the north throughout Sunday afternoon, Kabia said.
Clashes were also reported at Bugesera, south of Kigali.
Mortar shells fell in the centre of the capital during heavy fighting on  Sunday morning.
Meanwhile the number of Tutsi civilians who have been holed up for weeks  in the Mille Collines hotel in Kigali has risen from 300 to 540, Kabia added.
Some 240 more people from central Kigali and the suburbs have sought  refuge in the hotel as fighting raged in and around the city over the past  couple of days, he said.
Rwanda plunged back into savage ethnic bloodletting on April 7, a day  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart Cyprien  Ntaryamira were killed in what the Rwandan government said was a rocket attack  on their plane.
Since then an estimated 200,000 Rwandans have been killed and around  500,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries.

Graf said: "It was difficult to respond to her serve in the first set, it  really was -- even her second serve. She hit them very hard.
"It's difficult because you don't really get into a rhythm. There's a fast  game and then the next game you serve and you suddenly have to play a few  rallies."
As for going into the French Open in eight days' time, the German  favourite said: "I've played better the last two matches. It was good to have  some tough matches before Paris, and so hopefully I'll be prepared."
Schultz said: "I believed in myself but it's hard. She puts so much  pressure on you all the time. But it's the best I've played against her so I  can't complain.
"All the first set I was relaxed and I really thought I had a chance in  the tie-break. I should have made the backhand over the net, but it wasn't an  easy point."

Turtle Island swept to a convincing 15-length  victory in the the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh on Sunday, just a week  after being narrowly beaten in France's mile Classic.
Settled in last place by John Reid, Turtle Island cruised up to the  leaders two furlongs out. Guided Tour caught Ridgewood Ben for second on the  line.
Trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam said: "He didn't get the rub of the green in  France and perhaps I had been too easy on him. I knew he would come on for the  race. "But he is some horse - as good as I have ever trained.

Georgia does not possess the means to push for a  military solution in its breakaway province of Abkhazia and should accept a  Moscow-mediated peace accord signed Saturday, President Eduard Shevardnadze  said Sunday.
In a television address reported by Interfax, Shevardnadze said rejecting  the accord would mean pushing for a military solution. This was "justifiable  neither morally nor with regard to our capabilities."
He rejected opposition accusations that the peace agreement would entail  burying the country's territorial integrity if it allowed the secession of  Abkhazia, in northwestern Georgia. Separatist troops ousted Georgian soldiers  last September after a year of conflict which claimed several thousand lives.
"There is not one word on Abkhazian sovereignty or the creation of an  Abkhazian state in this text," said Shevardnadze, referring to Saturday's  accord. The agreement calls for a ceasefire and the deployment of Commonwealth  of Independent States troops within a 12-kilometre (seven-mile) buffer zone  separating Abkhazia from the rest of Georgia along the river Ingouri.
The president condemned the Georgian parliament for refusing Friday to  ratify the draft of the agreement. But Interfax said the assembly's decision  would not be legal as only the president, as head of state, had the power to  negotiate treaties.
Shevardnadze had earlier threatened to resign over the parliamentary  decision but Interfax said the deputies had adjourned a discussion on the  abolition of the presidency, also offered by Shevardnadze, after failing to  muster a quorum Saturday.
He was elected as parliamentary president by universal suffrage in the  autumn of 1992 and was later chosen as head of state by the assembly.
Saturday's accord followed an earlier agreement signed April 4 in Moscow  and which additionally foresaw the return of 200,000 Georgian refugees from  the conflict zone.
Abkhazian sources said the earlier agreement had not stopped several  clashes over recent weeks between the two sides, and the return of refugees  had yet to start.

Switzerland's Tony Rominger created history here on  Sunday by clinching a hat-trick of Tour of Spain triumphs.
The 1992 and 1993 winner also gave world number one Miguel Indurain the  perfect reminder that this year's Tour de France will be a major confrontation  between the two.
But Indurain, just one week before the Tour of Italy, refused to give  Rominger a psychological edge by immediately responding in kind, winning the  Tour de l'Oise at Senlis in France.
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert won the 165km 21st and final stage between  Palazuelos and Madrid to record his seventh stage victory, one more than  Rominger, who led the event from the first day.
Spaniards Mikel Zarrabeitia and Pedro Delgado shared the podium with the  33-year-old rider, with the Swiss rider's margin of victory -- 7min 28secs --  the biggest in the event since 1960.
Rominger admitted: "It was one of the easiest victories of my career."
Indurain wrapped up the four-stage Tour de l'Oise by winning a final 12km  time trial, averaging 47.937km to edge out Frenchman Eddy Seigneur by 5secs  and Britain's Chris Boardman, the former world one hour record holder, by 12.

French actor Gerard Depardieu and Cannes  veteran Roman Polanski brought some star quality to Cannes Sunday with the  first of Italy's four bids for the Golden Palm.
The two actors -- the biggest celebrities in town so far -- also brought  some knockabout humour to proceedings ahead of the premiere of "Una Pura  Formalita" (A Simple Formality) Sunday night.
"We actors are all huge prostitutes," Depardieu told a press conference  attended also by director Giuseppe Tornatore, whose 1988 Cinema Paradiso was a  huge arthouse hit.
"So that's it: he is not a huge locomotive," responded Polanski, referring  to Depardieu's notorious energy and size. "He's a huge tart," he said, as the  French star struggled to retain his composure.
The movie itself is far from funny. It tells the Kafkaesque tale of a man  arrested in the middle of the night, in the rain, in a wood, who is charged  with a murder he claims to know nothing about.
Polanski's character, the strangely nameless Inspector interrogating him,  is fascinated to discover that the man is no less than Onoff -- his favourite  author, of whom he claims to know every biographical detail.
Through a long and rainy night, the plot thickens gradually to the boil,  as large lapses appear in Onoff's memory of events immediately proceeding his  arrest.
Says Tornatore: "This film has nothing to do with Sicily or the South, a  common aspect of my previous three films. I haven't dealt wih the nostalgic  theme that was so important in "Cinema Paradiso" and "They're all fine."
"And most of all it isn't a pessimistic movie, a characteristic that some  say is particular to my vision of the world."
The film is the first of four Italian offerings in the main competition at  the international film festival here. The others are: "Barnabo delle Montagne"  (Barnabo of the  Mountains) by Mario Brenta, "Le Buttane" (The Prostitutes) by  Aurelio Grimaldi, and "Caro Diario" (Dear Diary) by Nanni Moretti.
Also premiered Sunday is the Canadian entry in the main competition of the  festival, "Exotica" by Atom Egoyan, a fetishistic psychological drama set in a  strip-tease club.

Around 9,500 mineworkers agreed to end an  11-day-old strike Sunday at the Kloof gold mine near Carletonville, 50  kilometres (30 miles) west of here, mine owners Gold Fields said.
The workers, who went on strike to protest the dismissal of a union  activist, decided to return to work after a mass meeting early Sunday  addressed by National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) president J Motlatsi.
Gold Fields said in a statement that the miners had agreed to seek  "alternative means" to sort out their grievance and that the first batch would  return to work on the Sunday night shift.
After Sunday's meeting about 200 miners were bussed into Johannesburg  where they gathered outside Gold Field's downtown headquarters to hand over a  memorandum to management repeating their demand that NUM branch chairman  Jackson Mafika be reinstated.
The mine dismissed Mafika after a disciplinary inquiry found that he had  threatened fellow employees for not taking part in a strike in March.
The strikers Thursday defied a court order declaring the strike unlawful  and ordering them back to work.
Gold Fields estimated production losses since the strike began at around  25 million rands (6.9 million dollars).
Miners returned to work at the Western Areas gold mine in the western  Transvaal Saturday where seven miners died in clashes between rival political  groups in the past month, owners Johannesburg Consolidated Industries (JCI)  said.
The seven deaths occured during a period of high tension between  supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and the African  National Congress.
NUM officials said politically motivated fighting between IFP and ANC  supporters started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first all-race  election.

Commonwealth observers supervising Malawi's first  multi-party elections said Sunday that they had received reports of campaign  violations in the run-up to Tuesday's polls.
The head of the 11-strong Commonwealth observer group, former Malaysian  minister Dato Musa Hitam, said at a press conference Sunday that he had  received reports of "various violations by parties" in several districts.
He said observers would "consider the various factors impinging on the  credibility of the electoral process as a whole and determine whether  conditions exist for a free expression of will by the electors."
The official electoral commission last month reported campaign violations  in nine of the country's 24 voting districts.
The commission, led by supreme court judge Anastasia Msosa, blamed the  ruling Malawi Congress Party for most of the violations, including seizing or  buying voter registration cards.
Some 290 international observers are monitoring the poll, in which some  3.8 million electors will elect a legislature and a president.
Eight parties and four presidential candidates will context the first  multi-party vote since Malawi gained independence in 1964. The country has  been ruled since independence by President Kamuzu Banda.
Campaigning ended early Sunday after opposition groups held several  rallies in the country's main towns.
The rest of the day was to be dedicated to "prayer and hope", with several  thousand people gathering at Blantyre stadium to pray for peace.
In keeping with electoral commission rules, counting will begin  immediately the polls close. The results will be broadcast by radio, but  official returns are not expected until Thursday.

Veteran US film star Clint Eastwood, the  president of this year's Cannes festival jury, was awarded the French National  Order of Arts and Letters here Sunday.
French Culture Minister Jacques Toubon bestowed the award on Eastwood in a  ceremony also attended by Federico Mayor, secretary general of UNESCO,  reminding the actor-turned-director that he first came to fame in Europe.
Toubon thanked Eastwood for "the pleasure you have given us in cinema" and  noted: "It was in Europe that Clint Eastwood first became popular, thanks to  the films of Sergio Leone, before becoming a big star in his own country."
During the 47th Cannes International Film Festival, Eastwood is staying in  a retreat in the hills outside Cannes.

Manchester United's international veteran Bryan  Robson is set to begin his managerial career at Middlesbrough.
The 37-year-old former England skipper, who was overlooked for the Red  Devils' FA Cup win over Chelsea, is touted to take over at the north east  Division One club on Tuesday.
United boss Alex Ferguson, who claimed leaving Robson on the Wembley  sidelines was one of the hardest decisions of his career, said: "Bryan made  his decision during the week. It would be unfair of me to discuss his plans,  but he does have plans. We have had a long chat."
Robson, capped 90 times by England in a career dogged by injury, remained  tight-lipped about the move, leaving Ferguson to do the talking.
"He has been a fantastic player," said Ferguson. "He's been the best  player I have ever had -- and that's not discrediting any member of our club.
"It has been 13 years of complete commitment. Every time every ball has  been kicked, whether it has been in training or in games, he's been in there.  He's been fabulous.
"It really was a tragedy we couldn't put him on the bench against Chelsea.  But there were several factors which I felt decided against that."
"Brian McClair's flexibility made him favourite to go on the bench. I wish  I could have picked two from five substitutes."
Ferguson added: "Management is all about decisions. You stand and fall by  them. But the one thing that Bryan knows, is that I took this decision in the  best interests of Manchester United.
"Someday he will have to make an important decision like that. Because I'm  certain he will go to the top in management. You just have to be honest and  look at things in black and white.
"I spoke to him last night, and said to him: 'If you were a manager next  week, what would you do?' and he said: 'I'd play me!"'

A South African soldier was shot dead in  Katlehong black township east of here Sunday by a gunmen who accused him of  supporting President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC),  National Defence Force Christo Visser said.
The incident followed the massacre of 12 people Friday night in  neighbouring Tokoza township, shattering three weeks of peace that held in the  wake of South Africa's first democratic election on April 26-29 which swept  the ANC to victory.

A South African soldier was shot dead in a  black township near here Sunday by gunmen who accused him of supporting  President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), a National Defence  Force spokesman said.
The incident followed the massacre of 12 people Friday night in  neighbouring Tokoza township, shattering three weeks of peace that held in the  wake of South Africa's first democratic election on April 26-29 which swept  the ANC to victory.
Christo Visser, a spokesman for the South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), said the 20-year-old army rifleman and a colleague, dressed in  regulation off-duty black and yellow track suits were confronted by four men  as they walked to a railway station in the black township of Katlehong.
"The men demanded to know why they were wearing ANC colours and asked them  what they were doing in the area," Visser said.
One man managed to escape and alert an SANDF patrol, but they were too  late to save the rifleman, who was found dead with a bullet in the head  outside a migrant worker hostel.
On Friday night, 12 people were massacred in Tokoza by gunmen who lined 10  of them against a wall and mowed them down execution-style. The victims, aged  between 13 and 25-years-old, were discovered Saturday.
Last year at least 1,600 people were killed in the townships east of here,  which have borne the brunt of political violence that has claimed 10,000 lives  countrywide in the four years since former president Frederik de Klerk  unbanned the ANC.
Most of the township violence has pitted hostel dwellers, mainly  supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), against  ANC-supporting township residents.
The death toll has declined steadily since the beginning of the year and  police told of experiencing their quietest time in years over the all-race  election which resulted in Mandela's inauguration Tuesday as the country's  first black president.
"Everything has flared up again here since we discovered those 12 bodies  on Saturday," said Visser, who spoke of a "hectic" weekend in the eastern  townships.
In another incident Sunday afternoon, troops threw a cordon around three  Tokoza hostels, suspecting that commuters in a taxi that had driven past the  hostels had been taken hostage, Visser said.
The situation threatened to degenerate when ANC supporters marched on the  hostels intent on "tearing them down," Visser said, adding that reinforcement  had been sent in and that the SANDF was poised to search the buildings.
On Saturday IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi -- now home affairs minister  in Mandela's government -- urged his supporters to work for reconciliation and  peace with their political foes.
"Go out and break down the barriers that divide you from you political  opponents," he said at a rally to celebrate his party's election victory in  his KwaZulu-Natal province power base.
Barely hours before he spoke Saturday, police and soldiers raided three  migrant worker hostels in Vosloorus, near Tokoza and Katlehong, and seized a  cache of arms, including 13 AK-47 automatic rifless, three handgrenades and  more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.
Although the ANC won a resounding victory in the national poll, it lost to  the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal.
The IFP came third nationally, after the former ruling National Party, and  together the three parties make up the government of national unity that will  govern for five years until fresh elections.

Riots, fires, killings and earthquakes are  being blamed for a dramatic drop in Japanese tourists visiting California.
Latest figures released by the California tourist board show that after a  1987 high of 44 percent, Japanese tourists are expected to account for only 18  percent of holidaymakers visiting the state this year.
In a bid to stop the decline, officials have prepared a series of  advertisements to be shown on Japanese television in a bid to lure back the  tourists and their much-needed money.
Japanese tourists are by far the biggest spenders, putting an estimated  3,000 dollars each into the California economy per visit.
The situation has become so bad that businessmen in the Little Tokyo area  of Los Angeles have drooped their prices in a bid to lure back the Japanese.
The Otani hotel, which virtually relies on Japanese tourists and  businessmen for its custom, has dropped room prices from 130 dollars a night  to 99 dollars.
"Japanese tourism is down. The business is down," said the owner of one  coffee shop.
"The older ones in Japan read the newspaper and they are scared to venture  out because of the bad publicity," he added, referring to the recent murder of  two Japanese during a car hi-jacking by gang members.
"Its kind of slow. There is a lot of crime here," said another Little  Tokyo shop owner.
Ryo Okura, vice-president of the Japanese International Travel Bureau, has  no doubt that the image of a crime-ridden city is hurting the tourist trade.
"Security is very bad compared with other destinations," said Okura.  "Honeymooners try to avoid this area. Before, Los Angeles and Southern  California was very popular with them."
Out of the nearly four million Japanese tourists who come annually to the  States only 785,000 visited California in 1992, almost half of the normal  figure.
To combat the steady decline, lawmakers are proposing increasing the  300,000 dollar annual budget spent by the tourist board to woo Japanese  tourists, to one million dollars.
"Sending ten Japanese tourists to California is the equivalent of sending  one American car to Japan," said John Poimiroo, head of the California Tourist  Board, to justify the jump.

British authorities reported an oil slick 10  kilometers long (six miles) in the English Channel Sunday following a  collision between two cargo ships, but insisted it was not a hazard.
The slick 32 kilometers (20 miles) off the Dover coast is dissipating and  is "unlikely to be serious," the Dover coast guard said in a statement.
The service said the slick had broken up into "three fairly small  pockets," the largest of which was 10 kilometers (six miles) long and 500  meters (yards) wide. The other two were several hundred meters (yards) long,  it added.
It was not immediately clear if the oil was from the cargo of one of the  ships or their fuel.
The collision Saturday involved the Taiwanese container ship Ming Fortune,  which was carrying dangerous substances including petroleum products and acid,  and the Panamanian vessel Ariake which was carrying fruit.
No one was injured in the accident, which occurred in thick fog in French  territorial waters.
Eight containers that fell off the Ming Fortune were floating in the  channel Sunday, and three of them contain chemicals, French maritime  authorities said.
The metal containers, which weigh between five and 10 tonnes, have been  spotted from helicopters but have yet to be recovered, the French maritime  emergency centre reported in the town of Cap Gris-Nez.
An alert was broadcast for ships in the region to watch out for the  containers. Nearly 700 vessels, one every two minutes, sail through the area  every day, the service said.
The Ming Fortune had been reported Saturday as being in danger of sinking  but the French authorities said the vessel had been saved and would be towed  to Le Havre Sunday night or Monday.
The other ship was towed to Rotterdam in the Netherlands on Sunday by two  British tug boats.
It was the fifth such accident in the Channel or North Sea in five years.
In December of last year thousands of bags of pesticide from a container  ship washed up on beaches on France's Normandy coast.

Northern troops loyal to Yemen's President Ali  Abdallah Saleh were reportedly closing in on the southern stronghold of Aden  in a three-pronged assault on Sunday.
A northern military spokesman, Colonel Ali al-Jaifi, said his Al-Amaliqa  (giants) brigade had broken through southern defences in the Abyan region,  east of the city.
An independent source in the south confirmed that heavy artillery shelling  30 kilometres (18 miles) from Aden blocked the road to the eastern town of  Zinjibar.
However, the south had mobilized its navy and air force to help repel the  assault, while Jaifi said his brigade had advanced to just 20 kilometres (12  miles) from the power base of Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid.
An artillery battle also raged on the northern front. Saleh's troops  pushed forward three kilometres (two miles) toward the key southern military  base of Al-Anad, an officer at the base acknowledged.
He told AFP that the northern forces were about 30 kilometres (18 miles)  short of the base.
"Our army is fighting a defensive war. The northern army has taken the  initiative in the conflict and is advancing on several fronts, but they  haven't made a decisive breakthrough," he said.
Al-Anad, stretching over several square kilometres (miles), serves as "the  (southern) joint command centre for all the military fronts," said the  officer, who asked not to be named.
Some 20,000 southern troops are based in the camp, he said. Al-Anad is  also a major air force base.
Outside the mountain base, 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the city, the  south has deployed anti-aircraft defence, multi-missile launchers, and  Russian-made tanks and troops carriers.
With the net closing on the port city, fighting was also underway on the  third front at Kharaz, near the Bab al-Mandeb, a gateway to the Red Sea, as  northern troops tried to approach Aden from the coast.
But in Aden itself, although cut off from the world apart from by sea, the  situation was still calm, a correspondent said. The city is sheltering  refugees from the fronts.
In the absence of casualty figures from either side in the 11-day-old civil  war, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said at least 175 Somalis  had died in a refugee camp near Aden at the start of the war.
The provisional death toll, which did not include wounded casualties, was  transmitted to a UNHCR representative and a Red Cross official in Yemen who  both reached the camp Saturday, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said in Geneva.
"The people in the camp are very frightened, without food nor water,"  Redmond said.
Of the 11,600 refugees registered in the seafront Al-Koud camp, only about  1,500 remain, he said. The rest had fled the fighting to seek refuge in Aden  and other regions.
On the diplomatic front, an Arab League delegation in Sanaa since Thursday  has so far failed to broker a ceasefire between the rival leaders of Yemen, a  country unified just four years ago.
The delegation met Abdel Aziz Abdel Ghani, member of the collective  presidency, who said Sanaa would agree to a ceasefire only if Baid surrendered  to go on trial as a war criminal.
Although the south has appealed for the Arab League to stop the fighting,  northern leaders have ruled out any foreign intervention.
The conservative North and formerly Marxist South Yemen united in May 1990  after drawn-out bargaining, but a simmering feud between Saleh and Baid  erupted into full-scale war on May 5.
In the latest evacuations, 500 people arrived in Djibouti by sea on  Chinese and Russian vessels, including 356 Chinese workers who were to be  repatriated by air on Monday. A group of 185 Egyptians flew to Cairo from  Sanaa.

Colin Montgomerie survived a 'squirrel scare' to  sweep Seve Ballesteros off the top of the European order of merit here on  Sunday by capturing the Spanish Open with a final birdie.
The big Scot, who won the 1993 money list with almost 800,000 pounds, took  his earnings this year to over 150,000 pounds when his closing 70 for an 11  under par 277 gave him one shot to spare over England's Mark Roe, Richard  Boxall and Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe.
It was Montgomerie's fifth European win and he achieved it with a  champion's finish after a red squirrel ran across the 18th tee as he was about  to drive.
His caddy Alastair McClean shouted to the Scot not to hit and Monty calmly  reloaded to hit the perfect drive and then an 80-yard wedge shot to within a  yard of the hole.
Germany's Bernhard Langer took fifth spot on 279 with Spanish stars Jose  Maria Olazabal and Seve Ballesteros taking a share of eighth place with 282.
McNulty's finale was even better than the winner's, striking a nine iron  from the light rough to within 15 inches of the cup for his birdie three --  but that only earned him a share of second place, on 278, for his final 71.
He lost his victory chance when he took bogeys at the 10th and 11th,  driving into the trees and then pulling a tee shot down a steep bank.
McNulty was still delighted, however, saying: "This is only my fourth  tournament of the year after I hurt my shoulder playing beach cricket during  the winter."
Langer blamed his poor putting for wrecking his hopes of a third Spanish  victory.
South African Ernie Els, who led the first round with a 67, repeated that  by claiming an eagle and four birdies to lift himself to a share of sixth  place, a shot off Ballesteros.
The Spaniard's 66 was the best of the day, equalling Montgomirie's score  on Saturday evening.

Aston Villa midfielder Kevin  Richardson, called up for England duty this week, celebrated by signing a new  two-year contract with his club.
Richardson, who led Villa to the League Cup in March, said: "I'm just  happy to have this sorted out. It's important for me to know everything is  settled.
"I won championship medals with Everton and Arsenal and would love to do  the same with Villa."

Handguns were used in almost one million crimes  in the United States in 1992, a record, although violent crime in general was  on the decrease, according to a Justice Department report released Sunday.
Handguns were used in 917,500 non-fatal crimes in 1992, a 50 percent  increase over the average for the previous five years.
The US government acted to limit handgun use late last year by introducing  legislation imposing a five-day waiting period to buy guns so that police can  check the background of the purchaser.
Legislation that would ban 19 semi-automatic weapons is currently being  worked out in Congress.
The Justice Department figures are based on the results of household  interviews nationwide with the victims.

Forty percent of Swedes remain opposed to their  country joining the European Union while 34 percent are in favour and 27  percent are undecided, according to results of a monthly poll by the SIFO  institute.
(The figures add up to 101 percent due to rounding.)
The poll results, carried Sunday in the daily Goeterborgs-Posten, shows a  two percent decrease in the number of those opposed to the union compared to  last month.
Those in favour also gained one percentage point this month and those  undecided jumped by two percent.
According to the poll, men are largely in favour of the EU with 42 percent  responding positively and 36 percent responding negatively. Swedish women, on  the other hand, remain heavily opposed to the union with 43 percent saying  they are against it and 26 percent saying they are in favour.
Sweden is to hold a referendum on the issue November 13, ahead of the  country's scheduled inclusion in the union in January 1995.

Police seized 112 kilosgrams (250 pounds) of  heroin over the weekend in Romania's biggest drug bust yet, television  reported Sunday.
The drugs were contained in 212 bags hidden throughout a car that had  entered the country from Bulgaria, it added.
It did not say where the seizure took place or provide the nationality of  the suspects.
Romania has become a major transshipment point for drugs, with 20 tonnes  seized last year.

A bomb attack Sunday on a cinema wounded 12 people,  including six soldiers, in Elazig, southeastern Turkey, the Anatolia news  agency reported.
A Russian-made explosive device was thrown inside the cinema premises  where 140 people were watching a film, the agency said. Nobody immediately  claimed responsibility for the attack.
Police launched a search operation in the town to find the bombers.
Three people were meanwhile wounded in an attack at Adana, some 110  kilometres (70 miles) from the Syrian border. It was not known who was behind  the blast.

Hundreds of black-shirted Italian skinheads  chanting racist slogans and displaying swastika symbols held a rally Sunday in  the northern city of Vicenza, state television reported.
The rally, which authorities had allowed to go ahead, went off without  incident under the eye of police and paramilitary carabinieri units.
As well as shouting anti-foreigner and anti-republican slogans, the  neo-fascist youths, many tattoed with Nazi symbols carried banners portraying  journalists as "terrorists."
"Our ideas will never die, because they have a style -- the fascist  style," one skinhead told state broadcaster RAI.
Saturday's march came as Italy's neighbours were coming to terms with the  inclusion of five members of the neo-fascist National Alliance in the new  Italian government headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini has qualified his movement as post-fascist  and described former Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini the "greatest  statesman of the century."
But he has repeatedly condemned the activities of the skinheads - whom  many Italians have nicknamed "Naziskins."

Three Germans fell to their deaths in the Italian  Alps while attempting to scale the Gran Zebru glacier Sunday, rescue services  said.
Manfred Lupp, 47, his wife Regina Alberta Hack, 48, and Karl Petri, 52,  were climbing one of the glacier's faces when they were swept away by a mass  of snow and ice. The three plunged some 800 metres to their deaths.
Two other climbers survived the incident, near the border with Austria.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said  Sunday he would visit the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of Jericho on  Tuesday to assess how self-rule was being implemented.
Christopher was speaking to reporters on the plane bringing him to  Damascus on his second peace shuttle in as many weeks between Syria and Israel.
He said he expected to meet up in the West Bank town of Jericho with  Palestinian leaders Saeb Erekat and Faisal Husseini "to have an evaluation of  the implementation" of self-rule.
The secretary of state wanted to see "how the implementation is going and  how the structures they (Palestinians) are setting up to receive aid, work."
Christopher will be the first senior foreign dignitary to tour the town  since Israeli forces withdrew on Friday, to be replaced by a Palestinian  police force.
A US official accompanying Christopher said the donors who had pledged  financial aid to the Palestinians were expected to meet later this month to  discuss an "emergency rehabilitation project."
"Israel needs to see that the Palestinians live up to their commitments  and stop the violence," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Christopher was set to arrive in Jerusalem on Monday from Damascus as he  launched another bid to bring the two countries back to the negotiating table.  He has not ruled out a return visit to the Syrian capital on Wednesday.
"There is a lot of work to do but the two parties are serious and they  have urged us to come back," he said.
But the secretary of state has played down his peace shuttle, saying he  did not expect a breakthrough.

The French domestic airline Air Inter said Sunday  that it was cancelling all flights Tuesday except those to Corsica due to a  strike by employees.
The company said in a statement that it would schedule extra flights  Monday and Wednesday to make up for the cancellations.
The unions called the strike to protest European Union regulations  requiring France to open its lucrative routes from Paris' Orly airport to  Marseilles and Toulouse in southern France to other companies.
Air Inter is 72.3 percent owned by the loss-making state airline Air  France.
The European Commission also ordered France to open the Orly-Heathrow  route to non-French firms on Monday, but French officials refused, saying they  needed more time to deal with overcrowding and environmental problems at the  airport south of Paris.
French and British authorities finally reached agreement Sunday that Orly  would open to flights from London by the end of June.

A shoot-out between Israeli  troops and Palestinian gunmen left four Gazans wounded on Sunday, Palestinian  sources said, as their new police force carried out its first investigation.
The army said two Palestinians aboard a truck from which the attack came  were lightly wounded.
Doctors at Khan Yunes hospital reported that four people who needed  treatment for bullet wounds said they had been in a taxi when the shooting  started.
The attack took place near the settlement of Morag where the Islamic  Resistance Movement HAMAS claimed responsibility for seriously wounding an  Israeli truck driver last Thursday.
The Palestinian police investigation was their first since Israeli troops  started last Wednesday to withdraw from most of the Gaza Strip, to be replaced  by the new police force.
Two policemen questioned the wounded in hospital and drew up a report  which was submitted to the joint Israeli-Palestinian military liaison  committee, an officer told AFP.
Under the May 4 deal to launch autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, all armed  incidents are to be reported to the committee.
In Amman, HAMAS spokesman Ibrahim Ghoshe said Sunday that the job of the  police was to protect their fellow Palestinians from attack by Israeli  soldiers and Jewish settlers, not to block anti-Israeli operations.
HAMAS does not rule out attacks in the newly-autonomous areas, he told  AFP. "The place and level of operations is decided by the military leadership  of HAMAS which is in the occupied territories."
Ghoshe said he hoped the police "will not block the national duty of HAMAS  in its struggle against the Zionist occupier."

Former French minister Bernard Kouchner and  officials accompanying him dived into a culvert to take cover Sunday when  their convoy came under fire as it entered Kigali, A UN spokesman said.
The convoy had just entered Kigali on its way back from Gitarama, south of  Kigali, where Kouchner had gone to meet interim government officials,  spokesman Moctor Gueye told AFP by telephone from Kigali.
Nobody was wounded, Gueye said, and the gunmen were not identified.
The convoy was being escorted by Rwandan government forces who have been  battling the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front for control of the city during the  past month.
Heavy fighting was reported in Kigali on Sunday.
UN soldiers in Rwanda are investigating the shooting incident.
Kouchner, former minister for health and humanitarian action, has spent  several days in Kigali holding talks with both sides in the Rwanda conflict,  which flared between the minority Tutsi and the majority Hutus following the  mysterious plane crash death of president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, on  April 8.
An estimated 200,000 people have died in the ethnic violence in the past  five weeks. Another half a million had fled to neighbouring countries.

The Moslem-led Bosnian army and the Bosnian Croat  militia formed a joint command Sunday in line with an agreement to form a  Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Radio Sarajevo reported.
The command is headed by Bosnian army General Fikret Muslimovic and Croat  General Ante Roso, it said.
Formation of the joint command was scheduled as the first step in creating  a joint Croat-Bosnian armed force called for under the federation agreement  reached in Washington in March.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said Thursday that merging the two  forces, which fought bitterly over territory in central and southern Bosnia  prior to the Washington accord, would be the most difficult aspect of the  federation pact.
Under the original agreement, the federation was to cover 51 percent of  pre-war Bosnian territory.
But last week Croat and Bosnian negotiators finalized their map for a  federation covering 58 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina, despite the fact that  Bosnian Serbs -- who were not a party to the agreement -- currently hold 70  percent of the territory.
A formal signing ceremony of the federation agreement had been scheduled  to take place in the presence of US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in  Geneva Saturday but was cancelled, reportedly due to US and Russian anger at  the larger territory sought by the two former enemies.

Emerson Fittpaldi failed in his bid  to wrest Indianapolis 500 pole position from teammate Al Unser Jnr here  Sunday, settling for a front row spot beside fellow Brazilian Raul Boesel.
Fittipaldi's four-lap qualifying run over the 2.5-mile (4km) oval was  227.303 mph (363.684 km/h), well off the 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h) standard  set by Unser in Saturday's rain-shortened session.
Conditions were warmer and windier Sunday, making top speeds tougher to  achieve. Fittipaldi, the reigning Indy champion, had minor problems in the  second turn because of the wind.
"It was much harder than Saturday," Fittipaldi said. "Conditions changed.  The wind was blowing harder. But Al made a great run. He deserves the pole."
Unser won his first Indy pole and a 100,000-dollar first prize. He will  make his first front-row Indy start 24 years after his father won from his  only Indy pole.
"There was a lot of difference in the weather," Unser said. "Conditions  changed 3 or 4 mph. We got lucky enough to go yesterday when the weather was  better."
Unser will start on the inside of the front row for the May 29 race, with  Boesel in the center and Fittipaldi on the outside. Boesel makes his second  straight front-row start, after going from the outside and finishing fourth  last year.
Mario Andretti, planning to retire after this season, qualified ninth for  his final Indy start with an average of 223.503 mph (357.604 km/h). He felt  the efects of the wind as well.
"I totally lost the front end," Andretti said. "I was chasing it. I was  looking all over the race track trying to get the grip."
"We just didn't have the setup for these conditions. We're in the show.  Now we can concentrate on getting ready for the race," he said.
Mexico's Adrian Fernandez and US drivers Robby Gordon and Jimmy Vasser  also qualified Sunday.
Canada's Paul Tracy was given medical approval to resume driving here  Sunday. He suffered a concussion in a practice crash Friday that kept him out  of qualifying Saturday, ending his pole hopes even though his car was among  the fastest in a week of practice. Tracy waved of a slow qualifying bid  Sunday, minutes after Fittipaldi's run.

Bryan Young hit a fine 90 to inspire  a long-awaited New Zealand victory against Northamptonshire here on Sunday.
Opener Young set up an eight-wicket victory to erase a week of poor  batting performances by the Kiwis --  and boost morale before the one-day  international series against England.
Manager Geoff Howarth's demand -- "We've got to toughen up and start  producing the goods" -- seemed to work after the tourists, without a win in  four previous games against county opposition, promoted former skipper Martin  Crowe to opener.
He (31), Young and wicketkeeper Adam Parore (60 not out) all took  advantage of West Indian paceman Curtly Ambrose's absence to set up a victory  with over ten overs to spare.
Young, without a half century in his six previous tour innings, blossomed  after a gentle start. He struck ten boundaries before edging a catch behind  off Mark Bowen when only two runs were wanted for victory in the 50-over match.
Crowe may well find himself opening again in Thursday's first one-day  international at Edgbaston.
And if New Zealand can bowl and field as tightly in Birmingham, England  will find themselves facing a real challenge.
The Kiwis restricted Northants to 188 for five.
Brilliant catches by Young -- at slip, to remove Alan Fordham -- and Simon  Fleming -- at long off when Mal Loye tried to hit out -- left the home team  needing Tony Penberthy's unbeaten 47 to achieve respectability.

Venice and Sarajevo became twin cities  Sunday.
"Venice wanted this twinning to express the deep bitterness of our  country, and I hope of all Europe, over what is happening in the entire Balkan  region, and the unacceptability of current European impotence," said Venice  mayor Massimo Cacciari after a signing ceremony here.
Said Bosnian consul to Milan Mohamed Kreseulyakovic, a former Sarajevo  mayor: "Don't be fooled by the television cover of Sarajevo over the past few  weeks; the situation is still dramatic and shooting is continuing."
Venice has already offered scholarships to Sarajevo students to study at  its university.

At least five people are dying every day in the  northern Angolan town of Ndalatando for want of food and medical attention,  official radio reported Sunday.
It said some 5,000 townspeople had returned to Ndalatando sionce the army  recaptured it from rebel forces on May 4.
At least 15,000 people in Ndalatando's Kwanza-norte province are suffering  from severe malnutrition, the radio said.

American Don Janicki and Ukrainian Lyubov  Klochko retained their titles in the Cleveland Marathon here Sunday, but rain  prevented a repeat of Janicki's 1993 record-setting exploits.
His time of 2 hours 15 minutes 4 seconds was well outside the course  record of 2:11:39 set last year. He was one minute in front of runner-up John  Kagwe of Kenya.
"I came here to defend my title and I'm happy I was able to do that,"  Janicki said. "I was never so nervous before a race as I was for this one."
Klochko won her third straight Cleveland title in 2:36:13. She pulled away  from Hungarian Karolina Szabo with about three miles left and won by more than  two minutes.
Kenya's Yobes Ondieki won the men's 10-km in 28:30, adding a third title  to the ones he won in 1989 and 1990. American Nadia Prasad won the women's  10-km in 32:01.

Ismail Kirui of Kenya won the  annual Bay to Breakers 12-kilometer road race here Sunday for the second year  in a row.
Kirui won the race, which starts on the San Francisco Bay waterfront and  winds through Golden Gate Park to the Pacific Ocean shore, clocking 34 minutes  and 3 seconds.
He was one second in front of compatriot Josphat Machuka, the closest  finish since 1984 when Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya beat Paul Cummings by one  second.
Kenyan Tecla Lorupe won the women's race in 39:10.

The Swiss Red Cross (CRS) will pay a monthly pension  of more than 1,000 dollars a month for life to around 30 people who became  infected with the AIDS virus after receiving blood transfusions from its  stocks, the Zurich Sonnagszeitung weekly reported.
CRS president Karl Kennel confirmed the paper's story to the Bern-based  ATS news agency.
A recent large-scale inquiry by the Swiss interior ministry into 315  suspect blood products delivered to 70 hospitals between 1982 and 1992 without  undergoing systematic screening found 52 people had been infected with  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Of the 52, 18 had died by the end of last  year.
The pension of approximately 1,500 Swiss francs (1,050 dollars) would meet  the sum demanded by the Swiss haemophiliac society. The exact sum will be  decided in June by the central committee of the CRS.
Back in 1990, the Swiss authorities came out in favour of paying the  victims a 50,000 francs lump sum compensation.
Jacques Barillon, president of the Swiss association for the defence of  haemophiliacs, described the mooted 1,500 francs a month compensation as  merely "a drop of water in an ocean of blood."
He said the announcement had come far too late and noted the CRS had  waited for the recent arrest of one of its top officials over the scandal  before itself reacting to the case.
A former director of the CRS' central laboratory, Alfred Haessig, was  charged earlier this month by a Geneva court with knowingly causing serious  bodily harm.
The court set up an investigation into the affair two years ago after  taking up the cases of several people infected with the contaminated products.
Haessig, now retired, has denied any wrongdoing, but will have to explain  to the court why the contaminated blood products were put on the market  unchecked between 1985 and 1986 when testing for contamination was already  available.

Around 25,000 fans welcomed Manchester  United's history-making heroes during a victory parade here on Sunday.
Alex Ferguson and his stars, winners of the FA Cup and League  championship, were driven through the streets in an open-topped double-decker  bus.
Just 150 supporters were waiting for the team when they arrived home by  train at Manchester's Piccadilly station. But the cup squad met noisy,  cheering crowds when they started their parade later.
Supporters jostled each other on the crowded pavements to get a better  view of their heroes who beat Chelsea 4-0 in Saturday's Cup Final.
The bus was flanked by 20 mounted police, half a dozen motorcyclists, two  police cars, three vans and an ambulance, although there were no problems  during the celebrations.

Rival Yemeni troops clashed northeast of the city of  Aden on Sunday, in the oil-rich Shabwa province, an official spokesman  reported in Sanaa.
The northern spokesman, quoted by the Qatari news agency QNA, said a  southern brigade had been wiped out as troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah  Saleh fought to seize Ataq, the provincial capital.
The fall of Ataq, some 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Aden, would help  the northern Al-Amaliqa brigade, deployed further to the west in Abyan  province, he said.
Saleh's army is fighting to close the net on the southern stronghold of  Aden, a port city, from three fronts: the west, north and east.
But a southern official, former foreign minister Abdelaziz al-Dali, said  on Radio Monte-Carlo that his side had won back the town of Daleh, 90  kilometres (55 miles) north of Aden.
The north announced the capture of the town of Friday and pushed further  south toward the key southern military base of Al-Anad.
Dali insisted southern troops had rolled back the northern advance to the  former border between the old North and South Yemen, and he dismissed what he  called the northern propaganda.
"The military solution pursued by Sanaa has reached an impasse," he said.
Several army units from the south and north were deployed on opposite  sides of the border after the country was unified in May 1990 as a measure  aimed at bringing the two sides closer. But they were not merged.
Units in the north loyal to Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid, a  southerner, were routed soon after the civil war erupted on May 5.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  President Hafez al-Assad explored ways to bring Syria and Israel closer to a  Golan peace deal here Sunday.
Christopher held four hours of talks with Assad right after arriving in  Damascus for his second peace shuttle between Syria and Israel in as many  weeks.
"The president heard the proposals that Christopher brought with him and  gave Syria's point of view on the peace process," a presidential spokesman  said, without elaborating.
The secretary, who made no comment after the marathon session, was to hold  further talks here on Monday before leaving for Israel.
"There is a lot of work to do but the two parties are serious and they  have urged us to come back," Christopher told reporters on the plane that  brought him from Geneva.
But the secretary has also played down his latest peace mission, saying he  did not expect a breakthrough.
Christopher was to deliver Israel's response to Assad's counter-proposals,  following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal from the strategic  Golan Heights.
The secretary did not rule out a return visit to Damascus before Thursday,  when he is set to return to Washington.
Now that it has helped secure the self-rule accord between Israel and the  PLO, the United States is determined to step up efforts to bring Israel and  Syria back to the negotiating table for direct talks.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five to eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
Syria rejected the offer and was also likely to turn down Israeli  proposals that Christopher try to persuade Damascus to set up a joint military  commission with Israel to "draft security arrangements" for the Golan.
Damascus has repeatedly said it would not surrender an inch of the heights  and that a total withdrawal from the plateau must take precedence over  security arrangements.
The government newspaper Tishrin said Syria was willing to discuss an  Israeli withdrawal from the heights on condition Israel pledged a complete  pullout within an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe.
A Tishrin commentary headlined "Will Israel take the adequate decision?"  went on to say that the ball was in Israel's court "and those who give it  support," in reference to the United States.
But diplomats here and in Beirut have said the exchange of messages  between Syria and Israel was a step in the right direction, although both  sides were far from a breakthrough.
A Western diplomat in Damascus said the counter-proposals submitted to  Israel by Syria "included some very specific questions which opened the way  for a concrete and serious debate."
Christopher also told reporters on his plane that he was to make a  symbolic visit to the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of Jericho on  Tuesday to assess how self-rule was being implemented at first hand.
He will be the first senior foreign dignitary to tour the town since  Israeli forces withdrew on Friday to be replaced by Palestinian police.

The main hotel in the northern  Bosnian town of Tuzla was hit by a large caliber shell late Sunday, but there  were no casualties.
There The shell hit the Hotel Tuzla at 10:15 p.m. (2015 GMT), heavily  damaging a room on the building's fourth floor. Two other shells landed near  the hotel.
The area around Tuzla, a mainly Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia, has  been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days.
The UN Protection Force spokesman for the northeast sector of the Bosnian  conflict, Captain Jens Kirk, told AFP here earlier Sunday that 196 shells hit  the nearby Vares sector, controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government  army, on Saturday and a further eight shells were fired on the town early  Sunday.
Vares lies aboud 45 kilometres (27 miles) south of Tuzla and straddles a  maze of routes linking northeast Bosnia to Sarajevo and the Dalmatian coast.
A further 100 shells rained down Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of  Tuzla, and a UN armoured patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms  fire on both Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said.
Bosnian government forces managed over the weekend to take control of Serb  positions at Vijenac hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla, "from where some  of the shells hitting our villages and Tuzla had been fired," Bosnian Colonel  Ekrem Advic, head of the press servic of the Bosnian army's Second Corps told  AFP.
The capture by the Bosnian army of "some 10 square kilometres" (four  square miles) of land in the sector was confirmed by sources close to the UN  Protection Force, who linked the Bosnian offensive and the shelling of Tuzla  Wednesday.

Former finance minister Hans Apel was named Sunday  to spearhead efforts to find a new partner for the giant eastern German EKO  Stahl steelworks, after an embarassing last-minute withdrawal by the Italian  industrial group Riva.
"We have a difficult road ahead of us," Birgit Breuel, president of the  Treuhand statea privatisation agency, admitted Sunday. "We need a solid  industrial partner and we are going to try to find one as soon as possible."
Breuel, speaking after a meeting of the company's management, unions and  regional and federal politicians, underlined the commitment of all parties "to  do everything to guarantee the company's profitability," including job cuts.
Riva announced Friday that it was cancelling plans to buy out EKO Stahl, a  key employer in the depressed eastern German region of Eisenhuettenstadt,  embarrassing the Kohl government ahead of October elections.
The deal, worth 1.1 billion German marks (700,000 dollars), would have  been one of the most ambitious privatisation projects in the former communist  east.
Apel was at the centre of a dispute between Riva and and the powerful IG  Metall union which led to the pull-out, as the Italian company refused to  accept him as a neutral member of the company's supervisory council.
The deal also came unstuck over the pace of job cuts, which would bring  staffing down from 3,000 to 2,300, and union questions about Riva's soundness.
On Sunday evening, regional premier Manfred Stolpe said Riva's pull-out  was prompted by domestic "Italian reasons", as the company wanted to buy two  steel works in Italy.

Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov  scored a convincing victory in the final time trial on Sunday to seal victory  in the Tour DuPont after leading the 12-day cycle race for the final six days.
Ekimov completed the 27-kilometer final stage from Kernersville to  Winston-Salem in 34 minutes and 3 seconds. His total overall time was 47 hours  14 minutes and 29 seconds.
American Lance Armstrong was second overall, 1:24 seconds behind Ekimov.
Armstrong finished runner-up for the second straight year in his country's  premier cycling event.
Italian Andrea Peron was third overall, 2:43 back.
Canadian Steve Bauer was second in the closing stage with a time of 34:31.  France's Jean-Francois Bernard was third, second seconds behind Bauer.
Ekimov, an eight-time world track champion who has broadened his skills  with a new mountain training regime, took the overall lead last Monday with a  24-second victory in another time-trial stage.
He maintained a lead of about half a minute over Armstrong over the  ensuing five stages through the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina.
"After I took the lead I thought about the final time trial every day,"  Ekimov said. "I thought maybe Lance could do something, but in the mountains  he couldn't pull away, so I felt good."
Ekimov, the 1988 Olympic pursuit gold medallist who won six races last  year and the Tour of Valencia in February, earned 40,000 dollars for the  Dutch-based WordPerfect team.
Armstrong, the world road racing champion, twice managed to knock four  seconds off Ekimov's lead, but he was unable to get any closer as Ekimov  finished just in front of just behind him in the last six stages.
"I did my best, but it wasn't good enough," Armstrong said. "Anyone who  wins both time trials deserves to win the race."
Three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, whose DuPont victory in 1992  made him the only American ever to win the event, finished 35th in the closing  stage and 22nd overall, 10:39 behind Ekimov.
Mexico's defending champion Raul Alcala, who won the prologue, tied for  ninth overall, 6:13 behind.

Amid rumors of a coup, renewed threats of street  protests, worker shutdowns and seemingly endless currency devaluations,  President Rafael Caldera's government is facing a crucial week, analysts said  Sunday.
Visits by Amnesty International and the International Monetary Fund are  putting an intense spotlight on the government as it attempts to defuse the  crisis.
Student demonstrations have shaken Caracas and ten cities around the  nation in recent days and Caldera has vowed to "not permit disturbances of the  public order provoked by subversive elements."
In a sharp departure from his usually low-key approach to social unrest,  Caldera has ordered the military and police "to act with total energy to  prevent or repress street demonstrations."
Students launched protests two weeks ago, alleging that the government did  not follow through on its promise to allow student-fare reductions on public  transport. They are also demanding the punishment of police who killed a  student at a rally.
Rioting students burned cars, attacked businesses and erected roadblocks.  Events took a darker twist Thursday when sub-machine gun fire from inside the  Central University of Venezuela heavily damaged two troop carriers.
The violence prompted the US State Department to notify its nationals  about the demonstrations and warn them to avoid the disturbances.
---
In an attempt to preserve the country's international image, the minister  of defense, Angel Montero Revette, said the government will order a military  clampdown in the capital and the rest of the country if the violence continues.
The government will not permit the country to fall into a state of anarchy  or civil war he vowed.
Tension increased Friday when former commander Hugo Chavez -- leader of a  February 1992 coup attempt against now-dismissed president Carlos Andres Perez  -- accused the military of "cooking up" a coup d'etat.
But Revette denied that the military was conspiring to overthrow the  government.
Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has devalued 10 percent in the last  five days, despite efforts from the Central Reserve Bank to prop it up.
A general strike by 15,000 workers in the courts system will continue this  week and separate protest marches are expected to be held by street vendors  and journalists in Caracas.
And adding to the pressure on the government, an Amnesty International  team arrived in Caracas late Saturday to check allegations of excesses by  security forces.
Also, a group from the IMF was due to arrive Sunday on a routine  inspection of Venezuela's economy.

The main hotel in the northern  Bosnian town of Tuzla was hit late Sunday by a large-caliber artillery shell  fired from Serb positions, but there were no casualties.
The shell hit the Hotel Tuzla at 10:15 p.m. (2015 GMT), heavily damaging a  room on the building's fourth floor and part of the third floor. Two other  shells landed near the hotel.
An expert from the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), inspecting the damage,  told AFP the 122mm howitzer shell had been fired from Serb positions in the  south-east.
The area around Tuzla, a mainly Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia, has  been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days.
The hotel, which is housing foreign journalists covering the fighting,  lies right next to the headquarters of the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government  army's Second Corps in charge of operations in the sector.
The hotel was also occupied by visiting men's and women's basketball  teams, in town to dispute the Bosnia Cup despite the fighting.
The army headquarters had been the scene Sunday afternoon of a special  ceremony in which the corp's commander-in-chief, Hazim Cadic, distributed  diplomas to local "patriotic personalities" to commemorate the May 15 start of  hostilities in Tuzla two years ago.
Firing began right after local television broadcast the ceremony, and one  shell landed near the television offices.
Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have been accusing each other of preparing  large-scale offensives with massive reinforcements in this strategic area.
On Wednesday, shelling killed two people and seriously wounded four in the  old sector of the town, not far from the hotel.
The UN Protection Force spokesman for the northeast sector of the Bosnian  conflict, Captain Jens Kirk, told AFP here earlier Sunday that 196 shells hit  the nearby Vares sector, controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government  army, on Saturday and a further eight shells were fired on the town early  Sunday.
Vares lies aboud 45 kilometres (27 miles) south of Tuzla and straddles a  maze of routes linking northeast Bosnia to Sarajevo and the Dalmatian coast.
A further 100 shells rained down Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of  Tuzla, and a UN armoured patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms  fire on both Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said.
Bosnian government forces managed over the weekend to take control of Serb  positions at Vijenac hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla.
Bosnian Colonel Ekrem Advic, head of the press service of the Bosnian  army's Second Corps, told AFP "some of the shells hitting our villages and  Tuzla had been fired" from those positions.
The capture by the Bosnian army of "some 10 square kilometres" (four  square miles) of land in the sector was confirmed by sources close to  UNPROFOR, who linked the Bosnian offensive and the shelling of Tuzla Wednesday.

The Yemen Socialist Party of southern Yemen  leader Ali Salem al-Baid, backed by five opposition parties, made a new  ceasefire offer Sunday in the civil war against northern Yemeni followers of  President Ali Abdallah Saleh.
Baid announced the new initiative, aimed at creating a "government of  national salvation," at a press conference along with leaders of the five  opposition parties, three of which are based in the north.
A similar ceasefire offer Friday was rejected by Saleh, whose forces are  advancing on this southern economic capital.
Saleh demanded the surrender of the southern leaders and recognition of  his national leadership as a precondition to any cessation of hostilities.
"This initiative in a historic step towards saving the country," Baid  said, adding that his followers "are opposed to war ... but will fight the  invaders."
Baid released a document titled "Agreement in principle for national  salvation," which set out as its primary goal "to save the country and  preserve the national unity" achieved when North and South Yemen merged in  1990.
The agreement calls for implementing a north-south reconciliation plan  agreed between the two sides in talks last February in Amman but which was  never put into action.
The three northern parties signing the agreement were moderate Islamic  Al-Haq and Union of People's Forces and the Unionist Organization.
In other developments a delegation from the Arab League met in Sanaa  Sunday with Deputy Prime Minister Abdel Wahab al-Ansi, head of the  fundamentalist al-Islah movement, the official SABA news agency reported from  the Yemen capital.
The agency said only that the talks dealth with "developments" in Yemen.
The Sanaa government has rejected foreign mediation of the civil war and  the Arab League delegation has not met with Saleh.

A former police officer shot four teenage  boys after reporting his home vandalized, killing two before he turned his gun  on himself.
Joseph Merola, a former officer in this central New York state town, shot  at the four when they bicycled past his house Saturdary. He had called police  20 minutes earlier reporting vandalism at his house.
Authorities did not release the names of the boys, but said they were  between 14 and 16 years old.
Neighbors said Merola lived alone, kept to himself and was not friendly.

England's Laura Davies won her second  tournament in a row and the second major of her career here Sunday, surging to  a three-under-par 68 for a three-shot victory in the LPGA Championship.
Davies, who won the 1987 US Women's Open before she joined the LPGA Tour,  pulled away from the field with birdies at 11, 12, 14 and 15, then parred the  next three for a five-under total of 279.
Alice Ritzman, who was seeking her first victory in 17 years on the tour,  bogeyed to of the first three holes but recovered to card a 70 for 282. It was  her eighth second-place finish in 402 tournaments.
Hall-of-Fame golfer Pat Bradley, Sweden's Liselotte Neumann and Japan's  Hiromi Kobayashi shared third place on 283.
Davies, who won the Sara Lee Classic last wee, earned 165,000 dollars to  take her total for the season to 467,628 dollars.
Davies overcame a wild tee shot at the 14th with a 20-foot birdie putt.  She hit another errant tee shot at the par-four 15th, but landed her approach  shot within 18 feet of the pin and made it to move to five-under for the  tournament.
Davies had won the now-defunct McDonald's Classic on the DuPont Country  Club course last year, but Patty Sheehan was the defending LPGA Champion after  winning the 1993 event in Bethesda, Maryland.
Sheehan started the day tied with Ritzman, one shot behind Davies, and  opened with a birdie.
She gave that shot back at the second hole. Bogeys at 12 and 13, followed  by a double bogey at 14, put her out of reach of Davies.
Meg Mallon, who shared the overnight lead with Davies, missed a four-foot  birdie attempt at the second and took a double bogey at the third when she hit  her tee shot in the water. She carded a 75 for 286.

Neal Lancaster won the biggest sudden death  playoff in the history of the PGA Tour Sunday, beating five other players to  win the weather-shortened Byron Nelson Classic.
Lancaster claimed the first victory of his five-year Tour career with a  four-foot birdie putt at the first extra hole.
He triumphed over David Edwards, David Ogrin, Japan's Yoshi Mizumaki, Tom  Byrum and Mark Carnevale. All were nine-under par after 36 holes in the  rain-plagued event.
It was the first time six players had reached a playoff, although there  have been seven five-man playoffs in the history of the Tour.
Though the event was shortened to 36 holes -- the lowest possible to  qualify as a complete event -- Lancaster reaps all the benefits of victory, a  place in the World Series of Golf, next year's Masters, and the full winner's  purse of 216,000 dollars.
Lancaster birdied every hole he played Sunday -- his final two  second-round holes and the playoff hole.
He was on the course when thunderstorms stopped play Saturday, and started  Sunday morning with a 60-foot birdie putt at 17. He birdied the next for a  second-round 65.
Then he waited three hours for the rest of the field to complete the  second round.
"The whole thing this week was patience," he said. "I waited for 40  minutes waiting for the horn to sound before I played 17. Then I had another  three hours waiting for the playoff."
At the playoff hole, Edwards drove into the gallery and picked up his ball  after four shots.
Mizumaki and Ogrin hit short irons to between 30 and 20 feet. Byrum missed  the green and Carnevale and Lancaster both got their second shots within six  feet.
Byrum missed his chip, Mizumaki left his long putt short and Ogrin's putt  dribbled right.
Carnevale's putt lipped out, leaving Lancaster to sink his winning birdie  putt.
"I was actually shaking," he said. "After he had missed his short one, I  knew I could miss, too.
"The good thing about the putt was that it was downhill. I could shake it  in. If it had been uphill, I would never have made it."

Russian special envoy Vitaly Churkin arrived in  the Serbian capital overnight to discuss a joint western-Russian peace plan,  the agency Tanjug reported as Serb leaders gave the proposal a cool reception.
Churkin was due to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday to  discuss the peace plan, endorsed by US, Russian and five west European foreign  ministers in Geneva late Friday.
But the leader of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb "parliament," Momcilo  Krajisnik, said they would insist on an end to all UN-imposed sanctions  against rump Yugoslavia -- made up of Serbia and Montenegro -- before talks  could begin.
"The (preparatory) contact group did not do what it should have done, and  establish that we do not want to negotiate as long as the sanctions are not  lifted," Krajisnik told the local Radio Jagodina Sunday.
He said it was "encouraging" that the Geneva plan "definitively accepted  the existence of two (separate) states in Bosnia" but complained that the  proposed territorial division did not take account of "quality" as well as  "quantity."
"One percent of Sarajevo is worth five percent of any other part of  Bosnian territory," he said.
The Geneva plan, a bid to put the peace process in Bosnia-Hercegovina back  on track, called for a four-month ceasefire and resumption of peace  negotiations within two weeks.
It held out the prospect of a "phased suspension" of sanctions in return  for "good faith" implementation of a peace settlement but firmly ruled out any  attempt to make sanctions relief a precondition for the resumption of talks.
The joint statement also backed a European plan for the ethnic division of  the former Yugoslav republic, providing 51 percent of the territory for a  Bosnian Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs.
Bosnian Moslem leaders criticised this as amounting to an endorsement of  ethnic cleansing.
The Belgrade-backed Serb forces currently hold some 70 percent as a result  their gains in more than two years of war and ethnic cleansing following the  republic's independence.

Canadian racer Paul Tracy expected a  front row start, and maybe a pole position, for the Indianapolis 500.
Instead, he will begin the May 29 race in the 10th row, trailing 27 other  cars.
A concussion suffered Friday in a practice crash kept Tracy from  qualifying until Sunday, ending hopes of a front-row spot alongside Penske  teammates Al Unser Jnr and Emerson Fittipaldi.
"It's disappointing because I had a shot at the pole," Tracy said. "I  don't think we would have had much problem putting all three on the front row."
Mercedes engines dominated practice here, powering Fittipaldi to the  outside of row one in addition to putting Unser on the pole.
Tracy qualified Sunday in Unser's back-up car. His four-lap qualifying  speed of 222.710 mph (356.336 km/h) was 7.2 mph (11.5 km/h) below his top  practice speed on the 2.5-mile (4km) oval.
Tracy was released from hospital Saturday but not cleared to drive until  Sunday despite his insisting he was ready to race.
"I could have run Saturday but the doctors would not let me," Tracy said.  "I have run in worse condition."
Tracy slammed into the third-turn wall at 240 mph (384 km/h) after hitting  the highest speed of his career.
"We were set up well Friday and just doing some fine tuning before the  crash," Tracy said. "I took turn three quicker than I had ever gone before. I  went out and kind of slid around it. Basically the tire couldn't hold the  corner speed."
Tracy's bid Sunday was nipped by warmer, windier weather compared to  Saturday.
"The heat came up and killed most of the speed," he said. "The weather  screwed up any chance we had at a decent time. I had a lot of understeer and I  lost a lot of power on my third lap. I thought my speed was pretty good for  running in the heat of the day."
Even though Tracy has the most powerful motor at Indy, he must move  through slower traffic before challenging the leaders.
"It's going to be tough but it's a long race," Tracy said. "We have to be  patient and move up during the race. We have the power to do it. We won't have  clean air like the cars up front, so I will have to adjust to that. I would  have liked to be higher in the field, but I haven't given up on the race."

Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was  scheduled to leave here for Houston, Texas on Sunday, to discuss US investment  prospects in India, notably in the just-opened telecommunications sector.
Later in the week Rao, the first Indian prime minister to visit the United  States in seven years, is expected to discuss a number of thorny issues with  President Bill Clinton in Washington, including India's ambitious nuclear  program.
But the first part of his trip was focussed on selling the advantages of  the Indian economy to outside investment under the reforms begun when Rao took  office three years ago.
In Houston, Rao, and an Indian business delegation travelling with him,  will mainly discuss the telecommunications and energy markets, including oil  exploration, at a lunch with more than 300 US business representatives, the  embassy in Washington said.
"These are priority areas for India today because of the economic  development process we're going through," said Ravi Dhapar, Indian consul for  commerce and information in San Francisco.
On Friday, the eve of Rao's departure, India announced it would open up  basic telephone services to foreign and domestic private companies, taking the  first step towards private phone networks.
The move is aimed at meeting an eight-billion-dollar shortfall in the   nearly 14 billion dollars required to modernise India's antiquated telephone  system and provide a phone on demand to its citizens by 1996.
India currently has 0.8 telephones per 100 people, with three million  people on a waiting list up to five years long and which is growing at the  rate of 15-20 percent a year.
Major US telecom firms such as US West and Motorola have been eagerly  waiting to enter the huge Indian market of nearly 900 million people.
On Tuesday he will go to Boston and deliver a lecture at Harvard, before  travelling to Washington, where he will attend a dinner hosted by the National  Association of Manufacturers.
Wednesday, the 73-year-old prime minister will meet with the Indian  Interest Group, which represents US companies with investments in India,  before addressing a joint session of Congress.
---
He is also scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary William Perry, the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, Vice President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
He is planning to meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  although it was not clear Sunday if Christopher would be back in time from his  current Middle East tour.
Rao departs the United States on Friday.
His visit comes at a time of US-Indian tension over a number of issues,  notably India's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes, Kashmir, human  rights and trade.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to cap  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defence programme, and the  Washington trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in  office.
Rao announced shortly before departing for the United States that India  was suspending the planned test Saturday of the new Prithvi missile, sparking  strong criticism that he was bowing down to US pressure.
The carrot for Pakistan in agreeing to cap its nuclear program is the  possibility of obtaining delivery of F-16 fighter planes it has already paid  for but which were frozen by Congress.
With India there is not such obvious quid pro quo, but there are areas in  which the United States could offer more help, such as science and technology  transfers, US officials say.
In any case, "the bottom line in all this is that you can't buy agreement  either from Pakistan or India on nuclear proliferation issues if they are not  persuaded that this is in their own best security interests," one said.
There has also been friction over Kashmir, with India feeling that the  administration of US President Bill Clinton favors Pakistan in the dispute and  has tacitly encouraged the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir.
Washington denies that Clinton has shifted policy on Kashmir, and says it  is a matter of Indian perception.

Secretary of State Warren Christopher was  expected to hold a second day of talks with officials here Monday to further  explore means of forging peace between arch foes Syria and Israel.
Christopher held four hours of talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad  on Sunday right after his arrival here at the start of his second peace  shuttle between Syria and Israel in as many weeks.
A Syrian presidential spokesman said "the president heard the proposals  that Christopher brought with him and gave Syria's point of view on the peace  process." He did not elaborate.
At the end of the meeting Christopher returned to his hotel room,  declining to make any comments.
The secretary was expected to deliver Israel's response to Assad's  counter-proposals, following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal  from the strategic Golan Heights.
A US source in his delegation said Christopher was to hold more talks with  Syrian officials Monday although no meeting had been officially scheduled.
Christopher was to leave for Israel early Monday evening and has not ruled  out a return visit to Damascus before Thursday, when he is set to return to  Washington.
On Tuesday he plans to visit the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of  Jericho to assess how self-rule was being implemented, becoming the first  senior foreign dignitary to tour the town since Israeli forces withdrew Friday.
Now that it has secured an accord between Israel and the PLO, the United  States is determined to double its efforts to bring Israel back to the  negotiating table.
"There is a lot of work to do but the two parties are serious and they  have urged us to come back," Christopher told reporters on the plane that  brought him from Geneva.
But he also played down his peace shuttle, saying he did not expect a  breakthrough.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five to eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
Syria rejected the offer and was likely to turn down Israeli proposals that  Christopher try to persuade Damascus to set up a joint military commission  with Israel to "draft security arrangements" for the heights.
Syria has repeatedly said it would not surrender an inch of the heights  and that a total Israeli withdrawal from the plateau must precede any security  arrangements.
The government newspaper Tishrin said Syria was willing to discuss an  Israeli withdrawal from the heights on condition Israel pledged a complete  pullout within an "acceptable and reasonable" time.
The commentary, entitled "Will Israel take the adequate decision?" went on  to say that the ball lay in the Israeli court "and those who give it support,"  in reference to the United States.
Nevertheless, diplomats here and in Beirut said this week that the  exchange of messages between Syria and Israel was a step in the right  direction, although both sides were far from a breakthrough.
A Western diplomat in Damascus said the counter-proposals submitted to  Israel by Syria "included some very specific questions which opened the way  for a  concrete and serious debate."

Captured Peruvian drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrara has accused high-ranking Peruvian military leaders of helping his  drug operations, according to press reports Sunday.
Chavez accused Eduardo Bellido Mora, a general currently serving as the  military attache in Israel and Major Carlos Rodriguez Cateriano, whose current  assignment was not identified.
Chavez alleged the two were among military officers who took payoffs for  drug shipments. He made his statements during an interview with members of a  government panel.
He was captured in Colombia in January.

Warm and windy conditions thwarted  Emerson Fiittpaldi's bid to take the Indianapolis 500 pole position from  teammate Al Unser Jnr, leaving him a front-row consolation spot beside fellow  Brazilian Raul Boesel.
Fittipaldi's four-lap qualifying run here Sunday was 227.303 mph (363.684  km/h), well off the 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h) standard set by Unser in  Saturday's rain-shortened session over the 2.5-mile (4km) oval.
"We were lucky the weather was hot, humid and windy," Unser said. "If the  weather had been like Saturday, Emerson would have outrun us."
Both racers use the new Mercedes-Benz engine that has dominated speeds in  its first appearance here in 71 years. The German-backed motor takes advantage  of an Indy-only rule allowing extra boost over conventional designs.
Retiring Mario Andretti qualified for his 29th Indy race Sunday, joining  Fittipaldi and seven others in the field for the May 29 race. The group  included Italy's Teo Fabi, Sweden's Stefan Johansson, Canada's Paul Tracy and  Mexico's Adrian Fernandez.
Fittipaldi will start from the outside of row one, the same spot he won  from here in 1989. The former Formula One and Indy series champion bumped  Canadian rookie Jacques Villenueve into the second row for the May 29 race.
"I was worried to even make the front row. I was concerned about beating  Villeneuve," Fittipaldi said. "It was much harder than Saturday. The wind was  blowing harder. After the first lap, I knew I could not do it. There was more  push and I had to back off on the second and third laps."
Andretti felt the wind as well but qualified ninth with an average of  223.503 mph (357.604 km/h).
---
"I totally lost the front end," Andretti said. "I was chasing it. I was  looking all over the race track trying to get the grip. We just didn't have  the setup for these conditions."
Unser won his first 100,000-dollar Indy pole and will make his first  front-row Indy start 24 years after his father won from his only Indy pole.
"There are two races at Indy," Unser said. "Winning pole is nice, but  we're here to win the race."
Between the top Mercedes racers is Boesel, making his eighth Indy start  and second straight from the front row. He began on the outside and finished  fourth last year. His Cosworth-powered Lola is the fastest non-Mercedes car.
"Raul has established himself as a great driver," Fittipaldi said. "He  will run very strong in the race.
Tracy, also powered by Mercedes, was approved to drive Sunday after  suffering a concussion in a practice crash Friday. He struggled to qualify in  the 10th row, a disappointing fate for a driver who had been a pole contender  before his crash.
Tracy and Villeneuve were not the only Canadians to suffer a bad day.  Scott Goodyear crashed at the entrance to pit row during a practice lap,  scattering debris from his wrecked car. He was checked at Methodist Hospital  and released with no injuries.
Johansson had problems much of the weekend but qualified safely.
"We struggled a little for the past few days but we're up to reasonable  speed now," Johansson said.
Three vacancies remain in the 33-car field entering next weekend's final  time trials. Should more cars qualify, the slowest are bumped from the lineup  and drivers must try to return in another car.
The slowest qualified driver, or "man on the bubble," is Mike Groff in a  Honda-powered Lola. Another Honda driver, Bobby Rahal, is next on the bump  list.

"I totally lost the front end," Andretti said. "I was chasing it. I was  looking all over the race track trying to get the grip. We just didn't have  the setup for these conditions."
Unser won his first 100,000-dollar Indy pole and will make his first  front-row Indy start 24 years after his father won from his only Indy pole.
"There are two races at Indy," Unser said. "Winning pole is nice, but  we're here to win the race."

Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was  scheduled to leave here for Houston, Texas on Sunday, to discuss US investment  prospects in India, notably in the just-opened telecommunications sector.
Later in the week Rao, the first Indian prime minister to visit the United  States in seven years, is expected to discuss a number of thorny issues with  President Bill Clinton in Washington, including India's ambitious nuclear  program.
But the first part of his trip was focussed on selling the advantages of  the Indian economy to outside investment under the reforms begun when Rao took  office three years ago.
In Houston, Rao, and an Indian business delegation travelling with him,  will mainly discuss the telecommunications and energy markets, including oil  exploration, at a lunch with more than 300 US business representatives, the  embassy in Washington said.
"These are priority areas for India today because of the economic  development process we're going through," said Ravi Dhapar, Indian consul for  commerce and information in San Francisco.
On Friday, the eve of Rao's departure, India announced it would open up  basic telephone services to foreign and domestic private companies, taking the  first step towards private phone networks.
The move is aimed at meeting an eight-billion-dollar shortfall in the   nearly 14 billion dollars required to modernise India's antiquated telephone  system and provide a phone on demand to its citizens by 1996.
India currently has 0.8 telephones per 100 people, with three million  people on a waiting list up to five years long and which is growing at the  rate of 15-20 percent a year.
Major US telecom firms such as US West and Motorola have been eagerly  waiting to enter the huge Indian market of nearly 900 million people.
On Tuesday he will go t"Boston and deliver a lecture at Harvard, before  travelling to Washington, where he will attend a dinner hosted by the National  Association of Manufacturers.
Wednesday, the 73-year-old prime minister will meet with the Indian  Interest Group, which represents US companies with investments in India,  before addressing a joint session of Congress.
On Thursday, Rao and President Bill Clinton will meet for two and a half  hours, then hold a joint press conference at the White House.
He is also scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary William Perry, the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, Vice President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.

He is planning to meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  although it was not clear Sunday if Christopher would be back in time from his  current Middle East tour.
Rao departs the United States on Friday.
His visit comes at a time of US-Indian tension over a number of issues,  notably India's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes, Kashmir, human  rights and trade.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to cap  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defence programme, and the  Washington trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in  office.
Rao announced shortly before departing for the United States that India  was suspending the planned test Saturday of the new Prithvi missile, sparking  strong criticism that he was bowing down to US pressure.
The carrot for Pakistan in agreeing to cap its nuclear program is the  possibility of obtaining delivery of F-16 fighter planes it has already paid  for but which were frozen by Congress.
With India there is not such obvious quid pro quo, but there are areas in  which the United States could offer more help, such as science and technology  transfers, US officials say.
In any case, "the bottom line in all this is that you can't buy agreement  either from Pakistan or India on nuclear proliferation issues if they are not  persuaded that this is in their own best security interests," one said.
There has also been friction over Kashmir, with India feeling that the  administration of US President Bill Clinton favors Pakistan in the dispute and  has tacitly encouraged the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir.
Washington denies that Clinton has shifted policy on Kashmir, and says it  is a matter of Indian perception.

Russia will pursue its economic reforms and adopt  the most resolute measures to limit the budget deficit and the emission of  credits, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in a contribution to The  Financial Times published Monday.
"Russia has only one path to tread - that of reform, and it will not  depart from it," the premier said, adding that Russia was "now living through  the trough of the economic crisis."
"In the next few months we can make a break from the basic negative  tendencies which have held back our developpment in the past two or three  years."
He said he was certain that Russia would make the break.
Russian output plunged 25 percent in the first quarter of 1994 over the  same period last year, according to the premier.
"We must adopt the most resolute measures aiming at limiting the budget  deficit and the emission of credits," he said.
"It is vitally important that every member of the Russian government fully  understands that a strong ruble is the indispensable condition for the revival  of the economy."
He said that the government's common task was "clear: to ensure that the  Russian citizens should know that everything their government does is directed  towards protecting the purchasing power of the ruble."
Chernomyrdin also underlined what he called vast structural disparities  that had accumulated in 70 years of Soviet rule.
"Tackling these problems demands prolonged efforts and huge expense," he  said. But he added that his government could not "sanction mass closures of  our exhausted plants."
Chernomyrdin said that three types of enterprises prevailed in Russia;  those that had already adapted to market conditions, those with the necessary  potential and enterprises that are beyond salvation and should be closed down  in accordance with the law on bankruptcy.
A solution had to be found for the last category with the help of foreign  governments and international agencies so that social problems closely linked  to their closure could be solved.

The three-time defending champion  Chicago Bulls pulled themselves together to post a 95-83 victory over New York  Sunday, evening their best-of-seven series in the National Basketball  Association playoffs.
Scottie Pippen, who sparked a storm of controversy when he refused to play  in the crucial closing seconds of Friday's game, which the Bulls won on a  buzzer-beating shot from Croatian Toni Kukoc, said the team had put that  episode behind them.
"I apoligized to the team and to Phil Jackson," said Pippen, who scored 25  points and led a third-quarter surge by the Bulls. "I don't think I have to  apologize to anyone else."
Game five will be played Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York,  then the series moves back to Chicago for game six.
New York suffered from the absence of starting guard Derek Harper, who was  suspended for two games for his part in a bench clearing fight on Friday.
Without their best ball handler, New York committed 15 turnovers leading  to 17 Chicago points in the first half.
Pippen scored Chicago's first points of the game. In the third quarter he  deflected two Knicks passes to set up two breakaway baskets for Chicago.  Horace Grant added 18 points for Chicago, and Patrick Ewing led the Knicks  with 18.
In the other Eastern Conference game, Indiana beat top-seeded Atlanta  102-86 for a 3-1 lead.
The Pacers, who had never won an NBA playoff series before, set a team  playoff record with 11 three-point shots, including four by Reggie Miller.
The Pacers can reach the playoff semi-finals with a victory in game five  in Atlanta.
In the Western Conference, the battle of the road warriors continued as  Houston won their second straight game at Phoenix to level the series 2-2.
The Rockets had lost the opening two games at home, blowing big leads both  times.
"They are not chokers ... they have done is just amazing," coach Rudy  Tomjanovich said after his team beat Phoenix 107-96.
Hakeem Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe dominated as the Rockets held Charles  Barkley to 19 points, compared to his playoffs average of 30.).
"In this business you go from the penthouse to the outhouse pretty  quickly, and I guess you could say I'm definitely in the outhouse," Barkley  said.

A small group which picketed the home of a  one-time South African white supremacist said Monday it did not regret its  action despite criticism from MPs here.
The former head of the South African chapter of the Church of the Creator,  Jan Smith, has been here for 10 days. He has previously written that the  heritage of the white race is "threatened by our deadly race enemies -- Jews,  kaffirs and the mud races."
Immigration Minister Roger Maxwell has called for reports on how Smith was  allowed to emigrate here.
But Dick Cuthbert of the Stop White South Africans Today (SWAT) group said  they had been "confidentially advised" that Smith will be allowed to stay in  New Zealand.
Cuthbert led about 30 protesters to Smith's home and chanted and banged on  the family's front door during the hour-long protest.
Cuthbert said further protests would depend on how people felt, the  government's decision on Smith's future, and whether Smith would comment on  his background.
"He might come out and apologise," Cuthbert said. "We will want to hear  what he says."
Any future protest would be "absolutely peaceful," he said.
However, Maxwell, opposition Alliance leader Jim Anderton and ruling  National Party MPs Ian Revell and Max Bradford have criticised the protesters'  actions.
Anderton said it was "the sort of tactic that you would have expected from  white racists in South Africa against blacks who have come into the area."

Six people died and three were  seriously wounded in an overnight shotgun attack in a Medellin, police  reported Sunday.
Unidentified gunmen fled the scene in a car after shooting at a group of  people gathered on a street corner in the north of the violence-torn city  early Sunday.
Initial police reports said the group was standing at a drug dealers'  gathering point and may have been attacked by vigilantes.

At least two Shining Path guerrillas were killed and  eight civilians wounded when the guerrillas ran into an army patrol, military  sources reported Sunday.
The fighting took place Saturday in Amarillo, a village in the Tingo Maria  area of Huanuco, about 500 kilometers (240 miles) east of Lima.
Guerrillas also attacked a police post in the village of Nuevo Progreso in  Huanaco, wounding eight people and destroying three dwellings, according to  media reports.
In Lima, bomb attacks rocked the city Sunday, resulting in at least one  casualty and considerable damage. A car bomb exploded in front of a 15-story  office building in the Miraflores district of the capital, injuring a guard.
Guerrillas are reported to have attacked a small bus on the outskirts of  Lima, blowing it up after ordering the occupants out.
In another capital district, bombers targeted a Telephone Company of Peru  building, tossing a dynamite charge at it from a moving car. The attack  damaged the building.

Timothy Carey, a veteran Hollywood character  actor whose films ranged from "Paths of Glory" to 1960s beach movies, has died  at age 65.
Carey died Wednesday after suffering a stroke at Cedars-Sinai Medical  Center, his son Romeo Carey, said Sunday.
Carey's career began with a part in Billy Wilder's 1951 movie "The Big  Carnival" and included more than 50 feature films and several television roles.
Some of his most notable films include Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing"  (1956) and "Paths of Glory" (1957) with Kirk Douglas.
In "The Killing", Carey played the role of a gangster who shoots a horse  to create a diversion during a robbery at a race course. In "Paths of Glory"  he plays the role of a soldier afraid of dying during trench battles in World  War I.
He also appeared in "One-Eyed Jacks" (1961) with Marlon Brando and John  Cassavetes' "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie" (1976).
He was born March 11, 1929 in Brooklyn, New York.

Tigers are facing the threat of extinction in  India -- the last bastion of the great cat -- because of continuous poaching  sparked by demands abroad for the animal's organs, experts say.
"The tiger is under renewed threat once again," said Arin Ghosh, who heads  Project Tiger, a conservation programme the Indian government launched in  1972, and which until recently was seen as a success story.
"It is an endangered species ... because of poaching to meet the demand of  trade of tiger bones and other parts," Ghosh said in an interview. "The threat  from poachers is real."
Indian officials say the demand for tiger bones is high and unabated in  such countries as Taiwan, China and South Korea, where the animal's organs are  used to make medicines, wines and soups.
The traffic is apparently so profitable that Indian poachers now prefer to  escape with the animal's more valuable bones and leave behind the tiger's  skin, which is difficult to camouflage.
"If the present trend is not halted, the tigers may come close to  extinction by the turn of the century," warned Ashok Kumar of TRAFFIC-India,  an affiliate of the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF).
The Indian government is not sitting idle.
India is home to some 3,750 tigers, or 60 percent of the world population.  That number is down sharply from the 4,334 counted in 1989 -- the first time  the count has fallen since the start of Project Tiger over 20 years ago.
Indian officials say they are forming "strike forces" to take on poachers,  and the environment ministry has set up a "tiger cell" to oversee the  nationwide campaign to save the cat, as well as activated its intelligence  cells.
The authorities' problems are compounded by a lack of interest in the  tiger's survival by poor villagers who live on the edge of tiger reserves and  depend on the forests for a living.
"There was indifference earlier because not much was done for the local  people," said Ghosh. "We are trying to build a stake for locals through  ecological development works."
But both officials and experts argue that Indian efforts to preserve the  tiger would come to nothing unless Taiwan, China and South Korea cracked the  whip on the booming trade in the animal's organs.
The danger was highlighted when the New Delhi police seized 287 kilograms  (631 pounds) of tiger bones from a Tibetan refugee camp in September 1993, the  result of at least 20 tigers being killed.
Indian officials say tiger bones are sold for 250 dollars a kilogram (2.2  pounds) in China, where they are used for making a variety of valued  medicines.
In Taiwan, a bowl of tiger penis soup, which is believed to boost  virility, costs 320 dollars, while a bottle of wine made from 10 grams of  powdered tiger bone can be had for 10 dollars.
Auctioneers deal in tiger claws, eyes, whiskers, pelts and testicles. The  skins, when they are smuggled out of India, head mostly for the Middle East  and the West.
About one million tigers reportedly stalked the earth in 1900, and in  India itself about 40,000 tigers roamed the wild before the country's  independence in 1947. The Balinese, Sumatran and Caspian species are already  extinct.
"Poaching is continuing unabated (in India)," said Kumar. "The enforcement  measures are not adequate."

An 11-year-old boy dashed into a  blazing apartment and rescued a two-year-old boy who had been left  unsupervised, police said.
The boy hero said he simply ran in and grabbed the toddler, ignoring what  the Boy Scouts taught him -- to crawl under thick smoke.
"I thought it would take me too long if I had crawled," said Jason Dent,  who was alerted by screaming in the upstairs apartment of his building  Thursday night.
Six youngsters -- the oldest was six -- had been left alone in their  apartment when the two-year-old began playing with matches and set fire to a  book, police said.
Two mothers, one of whom was having a birthday, had each left their three  children in the apartment and gone out to celebrate, police said. Both women  were booked Friday and charged with child desertion.

The Israeli army on Monday  quit the central prison and military administration buildings here, an AFP  correspondent saw.
Following the departure of the Israeli troops, 150 Palestinian police from  Egypt took control of the prison as hundreds of people were chanting and  dancing outside and armed Fatah activists fired shots from automatic weapons  in the air.
Palestinian police barred all access to the prison.
On Monday, Israeli troops continued to control the military government  headquarters, the passport and official documents department, police  headquarters, police barracks and Hof military camp.
They were to withdraw from the city by Wednesday.
Overnight Sunday, 450 police arrived in Gaza from Egypt, according to a  spokesman at the Palestinian police headquarters.
So far, 2,050 troops of the Palestine Liberation Army have entered the  Gaza Strip and Jericho in line with the May 4 deal to launch autonomy in the  two areas. Under the agreement, a total of 7,000 police will be brought in  from outside Gaza and Jericho and 2,000 others will be recruited in the  occupied territories.

New Zealand's awesomely beautiful South Island  high country may be on the verge of ecological collapse as a result of  rabbits, weeds, and ironically, the large flocks of sheep which used to  complete the once perfect agricultural scene.
A government review this week found 70 percent of high country "runs,"  huge sheep farms spread over six million hectares (14.8 million acres) of  tussock lands between the coastal plains and the snow covered Southern Alps,  are now marginal or simply not viable.
The runs figure large in the national mind: a major portion of the area is  named after the legendary outlaw James McKenzie, a Scotsman who last century  used to rustle sheep and hide them in a huge mountain basin. Today's MacKenzie  Plains, although spelt differently, are named after him.
A 19th century English novelist, Samuel Butler, gave the name Erowhon  (roughly "no where" backwards) to another high country farm.
High country author Neville Peat said on Radio New Zealand Sunday the high  country is "under siege."
"You have to feel for the farmers," he said. "The pastoral ethic, the idea  that sheep farming is supreme in the landscape has just about run its course."
Most of the land (20 percent of the South Island) is owned by the state,  which leases it to farmers.
Last year the farmers sought permission to introduce the myxoma virus and  a carrier flea as a way to control rabbits, first introduced here in 1864 and  now at plague proportions.
The government said no to the virus and instead commissioned a review of  high country farming released this week by Lands Minister Denis Marshall.
The review says the state should sell off most of the land, but that may  be difficult because it has found some of the high country has been so  degraded by overgrazing, rabbits and the invasive Hawkweed that no one is  likely to want it even as a gift.
Hawkweed, introduced just 40 years ago, has developed into a monoculture.  Of the 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of land in the South Island  where it occurs, over half a million hectares (1.2 million acres) are  dominated by the plant.
Hawkweed aggressively knocks out healthy native tussock as well as  non-native pasture grasses. Some runholders have had to reduce their stock  numbers by as much as 30 percent because of reduced pastoral productivity. But  the custom of burning tussock off has also destroyed the land.
Farmers put no fertiliser on 80 percent of the pastoral high country, and  grazing and burning of tussock deplete nutrients in the soil.
The review notes the declining levels of organic matter, nutrients and  acidity in the soil. If these continue to decline as they are doing, then the  ecosystem will collapse, it says.

Singapore's economy grew by a  better-than-expected 11 percent in the first quarter of this year, the Trade  and Industry Ministry announced Monday.
"Growth was mainly fuelled by the exceptionally strong performance in the  manufacturing sector and continued good performance in the financial and  services sector," the ministry said in a statement.
Gross domestic product (GDP) had grown by 7.5 percent in the same quarter  a year ago and 10.7 percent in the last quarter of 1993.
The first quarter growth exceeded the most optimistic forecast by private  sector economists who had predicted strong economic expansion, but not  exceeding 10.5 percent.
The statement said the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation,  rose by 3.2 percent from the year ago period and was one percent higher  compared to the previous quarter.

The world's biggest reclining Buddha will be  officially inaugurated on a hill in China's Guangdong province Wednesday.
The 16-metre (53-foot) high and 108 metre (356 feet) long statue will be  blessed by officials of the Buddhist Association of China and Tibetan Buddhist  Association in Sanshui city, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Guangzhou.
The hill in the southern province was chosen because local Buddhist  religious records claim a monk had a vision of Buddha there, according to  local Chinese press reports.
The Sanshui authorities have developed the site into a nature reserve.

Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd. has agreed with Philip  Morris Inc. of the United States to jointly develop food products for  convenience stores across Japan and the United States, a spokesman said Monday.
Seven-Eleven Japan, the largest convenience store operator here, will  start selling a low-priced canned beer made by Miller Brewering Co. Ltd., a  subsidiary of Philip Morris, late next month, the spokesman for Seven-Eleven  Japan said.
The spokesman said the two firms had been discussing a tie-up for the past  two years.
Seven-Eleven Japan, whose parent company is Ito-Yokado CO. Ltd., also  plans to develop and sell cheese and other products with Kraft General Foods  Inc., also affiliated with New York-based Philip Morris, he said.
Ito-Yokado holds a 50.75 percent stake in Seven-Eleven Japan and owns a  majority stake in Southland Corp. which operates Seven-Eleven stores in the  United States.
The tie-up between Seven-Eleven Japan and Philip Morris is the first such  alliance involving a major Japanese retailer and a major foreign food  supplier, major business daily Nihon Keizai newspaper said.

Miss Venezuela Minorka Mercado, 22, has won the  Miss Photogenic award at the Miss Universe 1994 beauty pageant in the  Philippine capital, organizers said Monday.
The six-foot, two-inch (188 centimetre) university student from Caracas  was awarded 1,000 dollars after being chosen from among 77 contestants by a  panel of foreign and local photographers covering the pageant activities,  which will culminate in a May 21 pageant.
Miss Namibia, Barbara Kahatjipara, a 21-year-old student from Windhoek,  also received 1,000 dollars after being chosen Miss Congeniality by the  delegates.

China is to offer financial incentives to  service companies to take on jobless workers as it battles to keep the urban  unemployment rate below three per cent, the China Daily said Monday.
Vice Labour Minister Zhu Jiazhen said Saturday that service companies  would get tax emptions and priority in obtaining bank loans and materials if  60 percent of new jobs went to unemployed workers, the report said.
State and private firms would be encouraged to set up such businesses, he  said. In the past, most service companies have been linked to state  enterprises.
"One of the best ways to control unemployment is to give full play to the  service industries irrespective of their ownership," said Zhu, adding that  efforts, including experimentation with share-holding, would be made to give  the businesses more autonomy from their parent firm.
Some 4.1 million people, or 2.6 percent of the urban workforce, were  unemployed in China by the end of last year, up from 2.4 percent in 1992. The  figure is expected to hit five million this year.
Labour Minister Li Boyong said last month the unemployment situation was  "extremely difficult," reflecting concerns that efforts to cut 10 million jobs  in loss-making state firms will lead to social unrest.
The influx of tens of millions of labourers from the countryside, where  some 130 million people are without work, is also putting pressure on city job  markets.
The labour ministry has launched a programme to register all urban jobless  to facilitate efforts to offer them work opportunities and expand the  unemployment benefit system.
Some 900,000 workers received unemployment benefit in 1993 and the figure  is forecast to rise to 1.8 million this year.
The China Daily said the ministry had also initiated a training programme  to help unemployed workers improve their skills.

Shanghai is set to record its second consecutive  year of negative population growth, the Xinhua news agency said Monday,  attributing the trend to changing social priorities.
China's most populous city, Shanghai became the first to record a negative  population growth last year with a birth rate of 6.5 per thousand and a death  rate of 7.5 per thousand.
The number of new-born babies is predicted to total 81,000 this year,  compared to 84,000 in 1993 -- the lowest in the eastern city's history.
Shanghai's population stands at 13.49 million, according to a recent  survey by the municipal statistical bureau.
The average marrying age for Shanghainese is 28.8 for men and 26.8 for  women -- three years later in both cases compared to a decade ago -- while  many couples are delaying starting a family to concentrate on their work.
Attitudes towards child-rearing have also changed markedly, with 85  percent of couples supporting China's strict one-child policy, and one-third  of them not caring whether they have a boy or a girl.
Some 92 percent of Shanghai couples use contraception, compared to the  national figure of 72 percent.
According to one 36-year-old dentist quoted by the survey, the new  pressures of China's market economy simply do not leave time for a family.
"My home is far fom the work place and I feel tired after a day's work,"  the dentist said.
"I cannot spare the time for raising a child."

China and Britain are set to launch rival  campaigns to win international acceptance of their Hong Kong passports.
Preparations for China's Special Administrative Region (SAR) document are  to be discussed in Beijing this week. China is expected to stage a world-wide  promotion campaign for visa-free acceptance of its passport designed for  travel by Hong Kong residents after 1997 return to mainland rule.
Hong Kong press reports said Monday, the Chinese authorities have already  decided to turn down British requests for help to get its British National  Overseas (BNO) document recognised.
A two-day meeting of the Preliminary Working Committee, China's so-called  shadow policy making body for the territory, is to see samples of the new SAR  document, the Ta Kung Pao newspaper said.
The Beijing run newspaper added that promotion of the document will be  launched as early as possible to secure a visa-free deal for holders.
Rita Fan, a former Hong Kong legislator who is head of the PWC law and  order sub-group, told reporters on Sunday that preparations for the passports  could be made before 1997, but stressed the document would only become valid  after formal endorsement by the SAR government.
Chinese sources said Beijing expected the SAR passports to be more  acceptable than BNO passports to Hong Kong residents after 1997, since the BNO  documents do not allow right of residence in Britain.
Around 3.5 million of Hong Kong's six million population have BNO  passports.
The key to the battle for influence will be to get other countries to  agree visa-free arrangements.

Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas claimed Monday  to have seized the town of Mongkol Borey, in northwest Cambodia, and to have  complete control of key roads linking Battambang, Sisophon and Poipet.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio said three columns  of guerrilla forces had hit government positions May 15 near the Mongkol Borey  bridge, at the town market and along the river south of town on Route 5.
The guerrillas were pressing their attack on both sides of Route 5, the  radio said.
With the "liberation" of Mongkol Borey, the Khmer Rouge controlled all  transport and communications links between Battambang and Sisophon, and  Sisophon and Poipet, the radio said.
To the north, the Marxist guerrilla faction claimed to have occupied  Sangkum Thmei district in Preah Vihear province in fighting on May 14.

More than 200 Chinese construction workers,  engineers and medical personnel arrived in Beijing Monday, after fleeing the  bloody civil war in Yemen.
Some 160 Chinese workers were flown home Friday and a further 398 were  scheduled to return later Monday.
Among the latest arrivals who flew in on a chartered Boeing 767, were 34  who had been stranded in southern Yemen ever since civil war broke out on May  4. The deputy director of a Chinese medical team, Zhang Chengjian, was shot  dead during their eventual evacuation.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week that China was "seriously  concerned with the worsening situation in Yemen and deeply grieved by the huge  loss in lives and property."

Vietnamese border police have freed 61 people,  including 31 children, sold into slavery for just 20 dollars to work for gold  miners in the centre of the country, a report said Monday.
Five people were arrested for luring people from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh  City with the promises of work and then selling them to work in private gold  mines along the Vietnamese border with Laos, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
The workers were sold for just 200,000 dong (20 dollars) and were forced  to work without pay and in "the most penurious conditions," the newspaper said.
Some had tried to flee from the mines but were caught and "beaten  mercilessly," it said.
Border police arrested five members of a gang selling people and  confiscated weapons after raiding the mines on May 10.

Japan's Toshiba Corp. said Monday it had developed  an overwritable optical-disc drive system which allows 606 megabytes of data  including video pictures to be stored on a 3.5 inch (nine centimetre) disc.
The company said the system, described as the world's first high-capacity  optical-disc drive, was a "dramatic improvement" over conventional rewritable  magneto optical-disc systems requiring whole sections of data to be erased.
Toshiba said the system's ability to store and retrieve large volumes of  data at high speeds enabled it to play up to 20 minutes of moving pictures  based on the video-compression format known as MPEG-2.
The new system uses double-sided phase-change optical discs, where the  reading and writing of data is done by converting the recording layer of the  disc from an amorphous state to a crystalline state.
A Toshiba spokesman said the system, currently at the prototype stage,  needed to be standardised to gain wider market acceptance but refused to  predict when it might become commercially available.

Twenty-one people were killed late Sunday when  two minibus taxis and a truck collided at Leeuw Gamka, about 400 kilometres  (240 miles), from here on the main road to Johannesburg, police said Monday.
A police spokesman, describing the accident as "very, very horrific," said  the two taxis crashed into each other before being hit by the truck, which  dragged one of the minibuses 150 metres (yards) down the road.
Bodies were strewn across the road, the spokesman said, adding that seven  people were also injured in the collision.

Japan and the United States are to discuss next week  a US proposal to expand the scope of bilateral cooperation to deal with global  issues, a foreign ministry official said Monday.
Japanese and US officials plan to meet in Washington on May 24 to consider  the additional items in "the common agenda for cooperation from a global  perspective," which is part of bilateral framework talks, the official said.
Proposals include increasing information exchanges to monitor production  and distribution of drugs such as cocaine and heroin and developing an  information exchange system linking Europe, the United States and the  Asia-Pacific region with an aim of preventing global warming, the official  said.
The framework talks have been stalled in the area of macroeconomic  subjects as well as specific areas such as automobiles, government procurement  and insurance, but Tokyo and Washington have been continuing talks on  bilateral cooperation on global issues.

China is set to become the world's largest  container maker this year with production expected to grow by nearly 70  percent to 420,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), a report said Monday.
Last year, China's container-manufacturing sector came out with a total of  250,000 twenty-foot equivalent units to become the world's second largest  container maker, the Beijing-backed Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoting China  Container Industry Association reported.
World's leading container makers included Japan, South Korea and the  United States.
However, the newly-developed industry is approaching saturation level as  the number of container makers mushrooms.
The association said foreign joint container ventures in China would be  "seriouly affected" in view of cut-throat pricing.
China's container ocean freight grew by 12 percent last year to three  millions TEUs, with 26.33 million tonnes of goods.
The country currently has 47 container ports.

China is to postpone a large number of share  issues until next year as the government tries to shore up the depression in  the country's two fledgling stock markets, the China Daily said Monday.
According to a circular issued Friday by the watchdog State Council  Securities Committee "a considerable number" of stocks scheduled to be issued  this year will be postponed until 1995 as the committee moves to standardise  the operations of listed companies and stock trading.
The Chinese stock market is still in its infancy and consequently its  development should be a "step-by-step process pursued on an experimantal  basis," the circular said.
The new attitude is a far cry from the heady days of 1990 when pent-up  demand for stocks spelled overnight success for China's first stock market in  Shanghai, followed by a second in Shenzhen, abutting Hong Kong, in 1991.
High interest rates and rampant inflation have stifled turnover on both  stock markets this year, with few indications of a short-term recovery.
Under the terms of the committee circular, listing companies must  henceforth undergo a six-month long coaching period organised by relevant  departments before beginning their public stock offerings.
The coaching period, which effectively postpones all issues planned for  the second half of 1994 to the following year, is aimed at helping firms  develop mechanisms commensurate with a share-holding company.
In 1996, the period will be extended to 12 months -- with six months  guidance given either side of the issuing date.
At the same time, the government is to strengthen supervision of  share-holding companies and stock trading, which until now have largely been  subject to the whims of the local authorities in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Guidelines for the transformation of management will be worked out to  prevent continued confusion over the responsibilities of board directors and  major shareholders.
The trading system will also be improved to curb rampant market  manipulation and insider-trading, which have dogged both bourses since their  inception.

Consumer financiers and the Israeli widow of a  computer game czar topped the list of Japan's biggest taxpayers for 1993,  while real estate dealers bowed out of the limelight as the end of the "bubble  economy" investment boom became more apparent.
Only 46 people in the list of the top 100 taxpayers issued by the national  tax administration agency Monday had made their fortunes through the sale of  real estate.
The figure, the lowest in 10 years, was down 20 from the previous year and  down 40 from the peak year in 1991, the agency said.
But 30 people made the top 100 by selling stocks, up 11 from the previous  year. Of them, eight were related to share sales by consumer financing  companies.
Yasuo Takei, the 64-year-old founder of Takefuji Co., which offers  unsecured loans to consumers, topped the list by paying 4.3 billion yen (41  million dollars) in tax.
He was estimated to have sold 10 million Takefuji shares for some 20  billion yen as part of preparations to list his company on the stock market in  a few years.
His 52-year-old wife, Hiroko, was ranked 15th by paying 867 million yen in  income tax, mainly due to the sale of some two million Takefuji shares.
Asya Kogan, the 69-year-old widow of Taito Corp. founder Mikhail Kogan,  was second on the list after paying 2.2 billion yen in tax. The Israeli  citizen sold 2,000 Taito shares when the company was listed on the second  section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in August.
Her husband, a Russian Jew, fled Stalin's repression in the Soviet Union  and founded Taito in 1953.
Taito has boosted its business through sales of juke boxes and  entertainment equipment, particularly the game "Space Invaders" which became a  worldwide hit before his death in 1984.
Her eldest son, Abraham, 44, was also ranked 10th by paying 1.2 billion  yen for the sale of 700 Taito shares.
Another consumer financier, Jinnai Ryoichi, 67, was the third biggest  taxpayer with 1.7 billion yen for selling 2.5 million shares of his firm  Promise Co. when it went public in September.
The popularity of Japan's first professional football league, which was  established last year, put Kawasaki Verdy star striker Kazu Miura on the list  ahead of other sporting celebrities.
Miura, 27, paid 137 million yen in taxes on payments from his team and  commercial endorsements, upstaging a galaxy of professional baseball players.
On Japan's political front, reputed kingmaker Ichiro Ozawa was taxed 49  million yen, three times what he had paid the previous year, for brisk sales  of his book on "remodeling Japan" into a nation with a greater international  role.
The book has sold 700,000 copies since it hit the bookstands in May last  year, bringing in an estimated 105 million yen to the 51-year-old author and  making him the seventh highest taxpayer among politicians last year.

The first major shipment of foreign apples to Japan  arrived at the western Japanese port of Kobe from New Zealand on Monday.
The 19 tonnes of apples represented the first significant import of  foreign apples since the Japanese government enacted a law in 1971 to  liberalize apple imports, press reports said.
Despite the formal liberalization, Japan had continued its ban on apple  imports from major exporters such as New Zealand and the United States, citing  possible risks from insects and viruses arriving with foreign products.
A total of four million to five million tonnes of New Zealand apples are  expected to enter Japan this year, an official of the Agriculture, Forestry  and Fisheries Ministry said.
The ministry has decided to lift the import ban on apples from New Zealand  last June as it had complied with technical limitations, the official said.
The ministry is expected to lift the ban on US apples as well.
The first load of New Zealand apples were expected to go onto store  shelves by around Friday after quarantine inspections, the official said.
Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) said the imported apples were unlikely to  be an immediate threat to Japanese farmers. A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of New  Zealand apples would cost about 800 yen (7.60 dollars), twice the price of  local apples.
Last month, when a sample consignment of New Zealand apples arrived at  Tokyo's Narita airport, Japanese apple growers passed out free samples of  their fruit to convince consumers that homegrown apples were better than  imports.

Philippine coconut exports plunged 55.5 percent to  220,900 tonnes in the first quarter due to a typhoon which reduced supplies,  the local industry association said here Monday.
Despite improved prices, coconut export earnings also fell 44.3 percent to  86.6 million dollars, from last year's 155.4 million dollars, the United  Coconut Association of the Philippines said.
A typhoon devastated coconut plantations in the eastern Bicol region, a  primary supplier, late last year.

Australian champions Adelaide City  hammered relegated English premier division side Sheffield United 3-0 here on  Sunday night.
City, who earlier this month retained their national title, took the lead  in the 18th minute when national team striker Carl Veart beat his man and  crossed for Bradley Hassell to push the ball home at the far post.
Three minutes before half time City made it 2-0 when Damien Mori raced  through the centre before setting up an unmarked Veart, who made no mistake  from 15 metres.
Three minutes from time veteran fullback Sergio Melta overlapped down the  right before crossing to the near post where Hassell deflected the ball past  United goalkeeper Bill Mercer.
Sheffield United manager Dave Bassett said he was impressed with a number  of City's players, singling out Hassell.
United, who won their opening match in Perth 2-0, have two more matches on  their Australian tour this week in Newcastle and against Australia's Olympic  team in Tweed Heads, New South Wales.

He is survived by his wife and a five-year-old son.

Ireland will give five uncapped players a  taste of Australian conditions in their opening rugby union tour clash against  Western Australia here Wednesday.
Tour manager Frank Sowman on Monday announced a young team including  uncapped forwards Keith Wood, Jeremy Davidson, Victor Costello and David  Corkery, and centre Martin Ridge.
Wood is a 22-year-old hooker from Garryowen; Davidson, 20, is a lock from  Dungannon; while Costello, 23, from St Mary's College, and Corkery, 21, from  Cork Constitution, are both included in the back row.
Ridge, a 30-year-old from Leinster who has played for Ireland A, is given  a chance at inside centre.
Sowman said: "Although we have gone for a youthful combination, the  uncapped guys are backed up by Five Nation regulars, including the star  combination of fly-half Eric Elwood and scrum-half and captain Michael Bradley.
"The Irish selectors certainly do not underate any opposition."
He said the selectors wanted to give all players an opportunity to show  their talents in the opening two games of the eight-match tour but it would be  difficult to include all 30 squad members.
Ireland coach Gerry Murphy expressed disappointment that his players would  miss the opportunity in the two Tests of opposing Australia's star centre  combination of Tim Horan and Jason Little.
Both incurred serious knee injuries in Queensland's win over Natal in the  Super 10 final in Durban on Saturday. The duo, considered the best centre  pairing in the world, are certain to miss the Tests in Brisbane on June 5 and  Sydney on June 11.
Ireland team to play Western Australia
Conor O'Shea; James Staples, Simon Geoghehan, Maurie Field, Martin Ridge;  Eric Elwood, Michael Bradley (capt); John Fitzgerald, Keith Wood, Peter  Clohessy; Michael Galway, Jeremy Davidson, Patrick Johns, David Corkery,  Victor Costello.

The International Natural Rubber Organisation  (INRO) opened talks here Monday, during which a new buffer stock manager will  be selected from six candidates proposed by the United States and the European  Union, officials said.
"The US nominated two candidates, while the EU gave four names. But it is  basically a decision that has to be made by the consumers themselves at this  (weeklong) INRO session," said Sucharit Promdej of Thailand.
Sucharit is the executive secretary of the Association of Natural Rubber  Producing Countries (ANRPC).
Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand are in INRO. ANRPC's other  members are India and Papua New Guinea.
INRO's present buffer stock manager, Aldo Hofmeister, is due to retire in  July after spending the past nine years trying to satisfy 26 governments  through buying and selling stockpiled rubber to stabilise prices.
"By tradition, the buffer stock manager is an American," said the 71-year  old Illinois-born Hofmeister, whose two predecessors were from the United  States.
The change comes as members of the Kuala Lumpur-based INRO try to bridge  their differences and prepare for the conclusion of a new global pact in  Geneva in October.
INRO groups six producing countries - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka -- with 20 consuming countries, including  members of the European Union, the United States, Japan and China.
It administers the 14-year old International Natural Rubber Agreement  (INRA) that has economic provisions with a "may-buy," "may-sell" and a  "must-buy," "must-sell" mechanism to guide the buffer stock manager in his  market interventions.
INRA expired in December and has been extended for a year pending  conclusion of negotiations for the successor pact.
Farouk Ishak of Malaysia, who is spokesman for the producers said  Hofeister "has done a good job and has kept within provisions that govern the  role of the buffer stock manager."
Producers have in the past criticised Hofmeister for being slow and  ineffective in intervening to prop up prices in a bearish market.
INRO members, who met last month to negotiate the new pact, are to meet for  their second round of negotiations in Geneva from October 3-14 to hammer out  the new accord.
"The main issue in the negotiations is the economic provisions that relate  to the buffer stock pricing mechanism. Consumers don't want any changes, but  producers want the whole mechanism reviewed," Farouk said.
"Producers want a new pact hammered out somehow by year-end. There will no  more extension," he said.
Producers, who met among themselves on the weekend ahead of the INRO  session, would further scrutinise consumers' proposals at a meeting in Medan,  Indonesia, in early August, Sucharit said.
The ANRPC meeting was chaired by Rosediana Suharto, spokesperson for the  producers in the INRA negotiations in Geneva. She is director of Indonesia's  national export centre.

Sri Lankan cricket skipper Arjuna Ranatunga is to  face an inquiry into his refusal to go to last month's Sharjah tournament  following a fitness row.
Ranatunga, 30, is to be charged with misconduct at a Sri Lankan cricket  board executive committee meeting on May 30, officials said on Monday.
Ranatunga, spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, pace bowler Pramodya  Wickramasinghe and batsman Dulip Samaraweera pulled out of the six-nation  Australasia Cup tournament in protest after vice-captain Aravinda de Silva was  axed for failing a fitness test.
The board advised national selectors not to include Ranatunga in the pool  for Pakistan's tour in July until the inquiry is completed but the three other  rebels will not be punished.
The executive committee said Ranatunga failed to provide a satisfactory  explanation over his conduct as captain.
"The other three got away with a warning because each of them made a  qualified apology. But Ranatunga is sticking to his guns," an official who  attended the executive committee meeting said.

Prince Christopher of Yugoslavia, a relative of  Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, has been killed in a road  accident in Scotland, it was announced overnight Sunday.
Christopher Caradjordgevic, 34, was the son of the late prince Andrei of  Yugoslavia and Christina Margarete van Eyck. He died Saturday.
The prince was known as Christopher George on the Scottish island of  Islay, in the Hebrides, where he had been teaching science at a highschool.

Saudi police laid siege to the Iranian pilgrims'  camp in Mecca on Monday to prevent them from holding an anti-US rally, the  official Iranian news agency IRNA said.
Commando units, equipped with grenade-launchers and machine-guns, arrived  in eight buses in the early hours and were stationed in front of the camp,  where the "deliverance from the infidels" demonstration is to be held on  Tuesday.
The police also prevented cars belonging to Iranian pilgrims and  organisers from entering the camp's parking lot, "even those with diplomatic  licence plates," IRNA said.
The siege followed the holding of a mass in the pilgrimage quarter in  solidarity with the Moslem people in Bosnia late Sunday, it said.
The head of the Iranian pilgrimage delegation, Mohammad Mohammadi  Reyshahri, urged for a "calm and orderly demonstration," against the United  States and Israel.
IRNA said meanwhile that the Saudi police had taken down several Iranian  flags placed on the roof of the pilgrimage quarter.
On Sunday, an Iranian religious organisation urged all Moslems making the  pilgrimage in Mecca to defy a Saudi ban and take part in the demonstration.
"We call on all pilgrims, especially politically-aware Iranians, to take  part in the demonstration as in previous years to foil the plots of enemies of  Islam," the Islamic Propagation Organisation said in a statement.
The Mecca gathering is the "best opportunity and Mecca the best place for  Moslems to express their hatred of the infidels, notably the United States and  Israel," it added.
Reyshahri has told the pilgrims that holding the rally was a "religious  must" and that everyone should participate.
Saudi authorities warned last week that they would not allow Iranian  pilgrims to carry out their demonstrations.
IRNA said Saturday that Saudi riot police had taken up positions around  the Iranian pilgrim camps in Mecca to prevent the rallies from being held.
Similar demonstrations triggered clashes with Saudi police in previous  years, the most violent being in 1987, when 400 pilgrims, including 275  Iranians, were killed. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were broken  off for three years afterwards.
The annual Moslem pilgrimage this year is to start on May 19 in Mecca, the  birth place of the prophet Mohammad and Islam's holiest shrine.

Three young East Timorese and an Indonesian are  being detained and tortured by President Suharto's elite guard over the death  of one of its commanders in Jakarta, East Timor resistance sources said Monday.
The CNRM (National Council of Maubere Resistance) released a statement to  AFP in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of the detainees.
The East Timorese resistance group said a fifth youth who acknowledges  responsibility for his part in what was described as the accidental death of  an off-duty Presidential Guard officer is in hiding.
But their statement, distributed by the the East Timor News Agency (ETNA),  added that he was willing to surrender and face justice if promised a fair  trial.
The incident was said to have happened outside "a gambling location" at a  brothel where the five had been forced to take jobs as bodyguards after going  to Jakarta a year ago on the unfulfilled promise of jobs.
"East Timorese students in Jakarta appeal to Presidential Guard members to  act in accordance with their professional oath and protect the people,  punishing wrongdoers in accordance with the laws of Indonesia," the statement  said.
"Those who protect the President should excel at protecting people, not at  torturing them."
The statement said the five young men were promised jobs in Jakarta by the  Indonesian Department of Labour and President Suharto's daughter Tutut.
The Presidential Guard commander was said to have been "hired by someone"  to expel the East Timorese men and went in civilian clothes to the centre  where he assumed that "as is usual in Indonesia, the civilians would be  frightened by his presence and follow his orders to leave."
Instead, the bodyguards resisted and attempted to chase the commander  away, "killing him in the ensuing scuffle."
Four, named as Hercules of Ainaro, Duarte of Lospalos, Domingos of Ermera  and Salah from the Indonesian island of Flores had been captured and were  being kept at a special closed prison at the Presidential Guard headquarters.
"Carlos is in hiding, a fugitive from the Presidential Guard, who are  quietly searching for him, aiming to keep the incident from being known by  their military superiors or the Indonesian press," the dispatch said.
"Carlos regrets the incident and is willing to be tried. However, he is  critical of the behaviour of the Presidential Guard members who were only  seeking retribution and not the enforcement of law when capturing Hercules and  the others.
"They have detained them in secret, without police involvement or resort  to legal process.
"It can be assumed with all certainty that the four captured are being  subject to horrifying tortures by the Presidential Guards.
"From the experience of many students who have been subject to military  police tortures in Dili, these troops are extremely harsh in their tortures in  defiance of legal procedures."
East Timorese students appealed to Amnesty International and other groups  to help protect fellow East Timorese "from the vindictiveness of the  Indonesian military", the statement said.
Sydney-based CRNM spokeswoman Margherita Tracanelli who released the  statement said it was based on information from sources which were considered  utterly reliable.
Indonesia is increasingly sensitive to criticism over its treatment of  inhabitants of the former Portuguese colony annexed by Jakarta in 1976.
The government refutes claims by East Timor groups that tens of thousands  of people have been killed since.

Southeast Asia's booming economies must resist  western demands to improve workers wages and welfare benefits in return for  more trade, Singapore deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Monday.
Lee told labour ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) that developing countries should determine the pace at which workers'  benefits evolve.
With criticism of labour tactics in some ASEAN countries the ministers are  expected to issue a strong statement on Tuesday rejecting pressure from the  United States and some European Union members to include social clauses,  spelling out workers rights, in future trade agreements.
"We cannot make changes to suit other's standards," Lee said, opening the  biennial meeting of labour ministers from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the  Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
While social clauses are seen as a strong weapon to help poorly paid  workers and stop forced and child labour in some Third World nations, many  developing countries see them as disguised protectionism.
ASEAN officials say the industrialised nations' new focus on labour  conditions is aimed at eroding their competitiveness by forcing them to raise  wages to levels in developed nations.
At talks in Washington last week senior ASEAN officials told their  American counterparts that they opposed any link between welfare and human  rights to trade.
"We should prefer that there was no linkages" between social matters and  human rights, said Lim Jock Seng, Brunei's foreign affairs permanent  secretary, after the Washington talks.
Lee said that while some advocates of social clauses were genuinely  concerned about workers' welfare, a greater concern was to ensure that workers  in developed countries cope with competition from developing nations.
"Such supposedly high standards will have practical consequences which are  quite the opposite of the noble goals they profess to promote," he said.
ASEAN officials have warned that higher wages and increased welfare could  force up costs, lead to a drop in foreign investment and bring higher  unemployment.
Singapore Labour Minister Lee Boon Yang said industrial nations' economic  problems could be traced to unrealistic and inflexible labour laws, generous  welfare and minimum standards.
"It would be unfair and unreasonable to demand such standards for  developing countries when these very standards have led to economic malaise in  the developed countries," Lee said.

World number one Pete Sampras heads for the French  Open hoping to clinch a historic 'mini Slam' of four major titles in a row --  and he has the full backing of the man he crushed in the Italian Open final.
Boris Becker, swept aside 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 on Sunday, hopes the American can  go the whole way and emulate Rod Laver's feat of 25 years ago.
"I hope that Pete can do it," the German said. "After so long it would be  nice for someone to achieve this."
Technically, a Sampras victory at Roland Garros would not earn him the  accolade of a "Grand Slam" because his wins, unlike Laver's in 1969, have not  all come within a calendar year.
But Becker argued: "It should be called a Grand Slam -- a Slam is such a  rare thing that four in a row should count even in different years."
Sampras, 22, only dropped one set on the way to the Italian title, on a  clay court surface where he has traditionally been vulnerable. That  reputation, however, has now been buried.
Sampras will be playing this week in the eight-nation World Team cup event  in Dusseldorf, Germany. His coach Tim Gullikson will be there to help Sampras  iron out problems with his serve.
"I'm moving much better on clay and that makes me feel more comfortable  about my chances at the French," Sampras said. "I've got to be considered as  one of about five or six favourites.
"But court conditions will be slower in Paris than they were here in Rome.  I just somehow hope to come through and win at the French. If I cannot win it  this year, there's always next year or even five or ten years.
"That's one event that I really want to win someday. It would give me a  title that a lot of the top guys in the game have never had."

The dollar closed higher at 104.87 yen on the Tokyo  foreign exchange market Monday, up 0.29 yen from the previous trading day's  finish of 104.58 yen.
Investors sold yen for dollars on prospects of less pressure to push up  the Japanese currency, dealers said.
The closing rate here was lower than 104.98 yen quoted in New York in late  trading Friday.
After opening at 105.07 yen, the greenback moved between 104.82 yen and  105.15 yen here Monday.
Spot turnover decreased from the previous trading day's 7.248 billion  dollars to 5.579 billion dollars.
Dealers said they believed that US pressure to bring the yen higher  decreased as Japanese and US officials were scheduled to resume framework  trade talks soon.
Officials of the two countries are to meet in Washington this week to pave  the way for framework talks, aimed at cutting Japan's huge trade surplus with  the United States.
The talks have been suspended since February when Japan rejected US  demands to set numerical targets in cutting the Japanese surplus.
A high yen helps boost Japanese imports and weakens the competitiveness of  its products overseas.
The mark closed at 1.6764 to the dollar here Monday, against 1.6705 the  previous trading day.

Australia will make a rush trip to Japan to replace  Argentina in next week's Kirin Cup football tournament, the Australian Soccer  Federation (ASF) announced on Monday.
ASF chief executive Ian Holmes said an approach had been received from the  Japan Football Association, offering to pay all the team's expenses.
Australia's late invitation materialised after the Japanese government  refused to allow Argentine star Diego Maradona to enter the country because of  drugs convictions.
Argentina, a World Cup finalist in the United States next month, pulled  out of the tournament in protest.
"We indicated to the Japan Football Association today that we didn't want  to see them in trouble and were prepared to fill the vacancy," said Holmes.
"Coach Eddie Thomson is putting together players who are available and  will be quickly looking for others prepared to participate.
"We have to work quickly to get entry visas and also to give the squad  some days together because the opening match is against Japan on Sunday  followed by France on May 26."
Thomson will have the benefit of reasonably fit players from national  league champions Adelaide City who beat England's Sheffield United 3-0 in  Adelaide on Sunday.
"We want to work very closely with Japan because we see them as the  emerging force in Asian football," said Holmes.
The ASF has been trying to establish close ties with the Asian football  region because of the possibility that world body FIFA would integrate  Australia into the area for future World Cup qualifying rounds.

A bus driver clubbed his step-daughter and two  of his own children to death before killing himself after a family row over a  dowry, police said Monday.
Leeladhar Chauhan's wife, Shakuntala, was also hospitalised with head  injuries after her husband went berserk at their home Sunday following a  quarrel over who should pay for the step-daughter's dowry, the police said.
A police spokesman said the man was enraged by his wife's insistence that  he pay for his step-daughter's wedding trousseau.
Chauhan, 38, picked up a spade and bludgeoned his 18-year-old  step-daughter, Beena, his daughter Kamlesh, 12, and son Vicky, 10, to death.  He also struck a neigbour who came to the family's aid.
Chauhan, an employee of the Delhi Transport Corp., hanged himself with a  skipping rope after the incident.

Police arrested some 70 hooligans on  Sunday night who vandalised a bar after a football match in Dessau, in former  East Germany, a spokesman said Monday.
Security forces intervened when drunken fans started smashing bottles and  setting off firecrackers after the match.
Nobody was injured and damage was not extensive.
The vandals came from Halle and Leipzig. They were released after  questioning and identity checks and put on trains for those cities, where  local police were on standby for their arrival to prevent further trouble.

A watchdog panel has sniffed out wasteful  expenditure by the Indian government, which rented kennels for non-existent  police dogs, press reports said Monday.
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India found the government had  spent 550,000 rupees (18,500 dollars) on renting kennels sanctioned by a 1982  project, the Pioneer newspaper said.
But the kennels sited at airports in Madras and New Delhi had no canine  inmates, while in Calcutta two dogs deployed in May 1985 died the same year  and were not replaced, the newspaper said.

Illegal sales continued to plague China's gold  sector in the first quarter of 1994, with state purchases unchanged despite a  17 percent jump in output over the same period last year, it was reported  Monday.
Sales to the state, unchanged on 1993, were down 35 percent on the first  three months of 1992, the China Daily quoted Ministry of Metallurgical  Industry gold bureau vice president Cui Dewen as saying.
Cui blamed the drop on a booming illegal trade between gold producers and  processing factories, which offer higher prices than the central bank.
Last year, gold sales to the state plunged 40 percent on 1992, the first  fall in 15 years.
The government tried to reverse the trend in September by raising its  purchasing price from 51.2 yuan (8.80 dollars) to 96 yuan (16.70 dollars) a  gram, in line with the world market.
However, when the value on the London gold market subsequently climbed,  the Chinese government failed to keep its pledge to peg its purchase price to  this level, forcing sellers back to the black market.
Processing factories, which buy gold from the central bank for 110 yuan  per gram, use the black market to make up for inadequate state supply.
Cui said the gold bureau and central bank would meet soon to discuss ways  to protect the country's gold resources and encourage producers to sell their  output to the state.
The market price of gold jewellery is about 140 yuan per gram.

The rand continued to drop to record lows  against the dollar, opening here Monday at 3.6525/40 to the greenback from  Friday's close of 3.6440/55.
Dealers said the local unit was suffering from continued dollar strength  and would likely remain weak against the U.S. currency.
The fianncial rand for non-resident investors opened at 4.92/94 to the  dollar, down from its previous close of 4.88/90.
Gold opened at 380.00/50 dollars an ounce, down slightly from Friday's New  York close of 380.50/381.00.
Other currencies were:

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher went  into talks here Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara as the  official press called for a "quick" Israeli pullout from the strategic Golan  Heights.
Christopher was then expected to leave for Israel on his second peace  shuttle between the arch foes in as many weeks.
The US envoy held four hours of talks Sunday with President Hafez al-Assad.
The government Tishrin newspaper meanwhile said that the success of  Christopher's mission depended on an "immediate Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan according to a well defined timetable."
Tishrin on Sunday said Syria was willing to negotiate an Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan on condition Israel pledged a complete pullout  within an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe.
Christopher was expected to deliver Israel's response to Assad's  counter-proposals, following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal  from the Golan.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five-eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
Syria rejected the offer and was likely to turn down Israeli proposals  that Christopher try to persuade Damascus to set up a joint military  commission with Israel to "draft security arrangements" for the heights.

Japanese authorities rescued seven Russian sailors   after their vessel capsized in the Sea of Okhotsk Monday, while a search  continued for an eighth crewmember, a Maritime Safety Agency official said.
The official said a Russian rescue vessel contacted the agency after  finding the 200-tonne SRP-119 listing in waters about 100 kilometres (62  miles) north of Mombetsu, and about the same distance southeast of the Soya  Strait.
The agency then rescued seven people from the timber carrier, and were  still searching for the eighth member, officials said.

Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motor Corp. has  indicated it would hasten technology transfer to Malaysia's car project  following Premier Mahathir Mohamad's warning that he would turn elsewhere for  help, Malaysian officials said Monday.
"I think they have got the message," International Trade and Industry  Minister Rafidah Aziz told AFP.
Rafidah said Mitsubishi officials she met in Tokyo recently were "willing  to look at areas" in the Proton national car project where Malaysia had  expressed concern over the firm's reluctance to impart technology.
Jointly produced by Malaysian parties and Mitsubishi, the Proton is  outselling Japanese makes like Honda and Nissan in Malaysia, where it commands  73 percent share of the passenger car market.
Mitsubishi Motor Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp. hold 17 percent equity in the  nine-year-old Proton venture, a cornerstone of Mahathir's ambitious plan to  make Malaysia an industrialised nation.
Mahathir in March had singled out Mitsubishi's reluctance to allow  Malaysians to design and produce the engine and transmission parts by  themselves and warned that Kuala Lumpur could turn to European, American and  even other Japanese companies.
The Malaysian premier toured the Citroen research centre at Vezily during  a private visit to France on May 5 and test drove several Citroen cars, some  of which were yet to enter the market, officials said.
Indications that Malaysia would continue to deal with Mitsubishi in the  car project came last week when Mahathir praised the Japanese automaker while  witnessing the signing of a tripartite pact in Beijing to produce car engines  and components in China.
"Malaysia has found our Japanese partners very cooperative, particularly  Mitsubishi Motor Corp.," Mahathir was quoted saying at the function.

Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui returned Monday  from a state tour in which he secured official ties with four countries,  including South Africa, the nation considered most likely to switch diplomatic  recognition to Taiwan's long-time rival, China.
Lee, who visited Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland, was  greeted on his return by a squad of high-ranking government officials,  including Premier Lien Chan.
His trip -- the first state visit by a Taiwanese president in 17 years --  was hailed by Taiwanese media as a success.
Leaders of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Swaziland signed joint communiques  with Lee during his visit there, and also pledged to support Taiwan in its bid  to rejoin the United Nations, which ousted Taipei to admit Beijing in 1971.
South African President Nelson Mandela, whom local press predicted would  shift diplomatic recognition to Beijing, said he had no plans for such a move.
"After my meeting with President Mandela, I can solemnly declare that the  relations between our two countries are very solid. You can feel safe to stay  and do big business here," Lee told Taiwanese business and community leaders  in a reception in Johannesburg, state TV reported last week.
Mandela, in a visit to Taipei last year, said he would not abandon China,  which had helped the African National Congress (ANC) for more than 30 years.  The remarks were interpreted as a plan to establish formal ties with Beijing  after he became president.
South Africa is the largest of the 29 nations that recognize Taiwan, which  has been embroiled in a diplomatic battle with China since the end of the  Chinese civil war in 1949. Taipei bans direct contact with Beijing after the  nationalist government fled here in 1949.
Lee told Taiwanese reporters in South Africa Sunday that his visits to the  four countries were significant, as China had done all it could to try to  isolate Taiwan internationally.
"The Chinese communists have been unfriendly to us.... We have stopped  treating them as enemy, but still they threaten to invade us," the Taiwan  Television Enterprise quoted Lee as saying.
Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and has warned other countries  against forging ties with Taipei.

Mark Taylor is hot favourite to be named this week  to succeed Allan Border in the toughest job in Australian sport.
Taylor has been heir apparent to the Australian cricket captain for the  past two years. He is not the only candidate, but it would be a major shock  for the selectors not to pick the 29-year-old New South Wales batsman after  Border decided to retire last week.
It won't be easy though. Leading the Australian cricket team reduced Kim  Hughes to tears and even Border once threatened to resign, while at the height  of his career, from the most prestigious position in this sports-orientated  nation.
The Australian Cricket Board is expected to announce the new captain, and  his deputy, on Thursday or Friday. The make-up of the Australian team to tour  Sri Lanka and Pakistan from September will also be revealed. England visit  after that and there is also the World Cup in 1995.
Taylor, 29, who has led Australia in nine limited-over internationals,  winning six one-day matches, is likely to offer a more co-operative approach  to the team captaincy.
For all Border's unparalleled deeds -- test cricket's greatest scorer with  11,174 runs, spiced with a record 156 catches and 93 matches as captain --  critics pointed to his questionable communication skills, sharp mood swings  and negative test strategies.
Taylor is untried in the pressure-cooker demands at test level, but he is  calm, level-headed with tactical flair. When required he can take a hard-line  with players.
Affable, he is nicknamed "Tubby" by fellow players.
In 54 tests the left-handed opening batsman has accumulated 4,275 runs at  an average of 46.97 with 12 hundreds.
His only flaw would appear to be his failure, in the selectors' eyes, to  nail down a spot in the one-day team, with some pointing to his labouring  scoring rate at the start of innings.
But he is liked and respected by teammates, he is articulate and appears  to be held in high regard by cricket officialdom.
David Boon, the country's fourth highest run-getter in tests behind  Border, Greg Chappell and Donald Bradman, wins on experience with 89 Tests,  but the Tasmania player will be 34 next season and cannot be considered a  long-term proposition.
Taylor's state teammate Steve Waugh, who headed the Australian batting  averages in the three test series against New Zealand and South Africa home  and away last season, is a plausible candidate.
Waugh, the twin brother of upper order batsman Mark, is regarded by  teammates as the cricket brain of the test side and an intense competitor. His  game has toughened over the last few seasons and, approaching 29, he looms as  a definite contender.
Waugh, a brilliant one-day performer, has played 65 tests scoring almost  3,500 runs at a healthy average of 43.68 with seven centuries.
Queensland wicketkeeper Ian Healy, recently turned 30, has the drawback of  his strained past relations with umpires. His cause could be hindered at a  time when the ACB are sensitive about player behaviour in the wake of the  Shane Warne-Merv Hughes incidents in South Africa earlier this year.
But if Waugh is disappointed in the captain's stakes he will still be a  strong contender with Healy to be Taylor's vice-captain.

Eurotunnel's freight shuttle is to begin moving  through its tunnel under the English Channel on Thursday and the first French  SNCF and British rail merchandise trains will circulate this week, Eurotunnel  said in a communique.
It said it had received the green light from the intergovernmental  commission overseeing use of the tunnel.
Eurotunnel also said it would be paying its first dividends based on  results in the year 2003. It expects revenue of 5.139 billion francs (901  million dollars) in 1995, rising to 7.19 billion francs (1.26 billion dollars)  in 1996.
Independent consultants SETECE-WSA expect revenue of 12.92 billion francs  in 2003, rising to 22.32 billion francs in 2013.
Eurotunnel said it would have 22 percent of crosschannel passenger traffic  in 1995, or some 16.31 million travelers, rising to 28 percent in 1996.
For goods, Eurotunnel expects 11.4 percent, or 11.4 million tons, in 1995,  rising to 15.6 percent in 1996 (16.01 million tons).

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda  (MINUAR) on Monday protested to the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front over shots  fired at a convoy in which former French minister Bernard Kouchner was  traveling.
Gunmen opened fire Sunday on the convoy, forcing the former minister for  humanitarian action and officials accompanying him to leave their vehicles and  dive for cover.
The incident happened as Kouchner was on his way back from visiting  Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of the capital Kigali, where he  met officials in the interim government.
UN spokesman Moctar Gueye was hit in the face by fragments and had to go  to Nairobi for treatment on Monday. Nobody else was injured in the shootout,  which happened three kilometres (a mile and a half) outside Kigali.
Gueye said MINUAR had also formally complained to the government forces  escorting the convoy, which had proved unable to ensure its complete security.
Kouchner, who has been in Kigali since Thursday, has met all parties to  the conflict, which flared between the minority Tutsi and the majority Hutus  in the wake of the plane crash which killed the country's Hutu president  Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6.
He has also visited various camps for displaced persons and two  orphanages. He has been trying to persuade the warring sides and militia to  allow these "hostages" of the conflict to leave the capital by taking  "humanitarian corridors" between the city centres and the airport.
His efforts had still not borne fruit on Monday, but Gueye said the  situation could change. Kouchner was scheduled to have left on Sunday but was  still in Kigali on Monday.
Gueye said Kigali was very quiet on Monday because of heavy rain. Some  shots were fired during the night but the positions remained roughly the same  and it was a waiting game.
There were fierce clashes on Sunday between government forces and RPF  rebels in Kigali and several other towns, notably Ruhengeri in the northwest,  and Bugesera, south of Kigali. The rebels are moving from east to west, south  of the capital, towards Gitarama, where the interim government has taken  refuge.
A estimated 200,000 people have died in the ethnic violence which has raged  across the tiny highland central African state in the past five weeks and half  a million people have fled to neighbouring countries.

Sales at Tokyo department stores in April fell 4.5  percent from a year earlier to mark the 26th year-on-year decline, an industry  association said Monday.
April sales at 27 outlets last month totaled 191.09 billion yen (1.8  billion dollars), the Japan Department Stores' Association said.
Association officials said that Tokyo department store sales this month  were expected to remain sluggish.

Iran could break ties with Britain if London failed  to provide a convincing explanation over the alleged bugging of the Iranian  embassy, MP Majid Naderi said Monday.
Tehran said last Wednesday that a listening device had been found late  April inside a wall at the Iranian embassy in London. Britain has refused to  comment on the affair.
Naderi, a member of parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, told Abrar  newspaper there was a possibility "of any kind of conflict" with London, but  that the National Security Council would have to give its opinion first.
"If the British government does not come up with a convincing explanation  over the spying, a break in relations is possible," he said.
Tehran has strongly protested against the bugging and said it would  "weaken relations with Britain."
Several newspapers here have urged the government to reconsider economic  ties with Britain, which is Iran's fourth biggest trade partner.

A French warning about pulling troops out of Bosnia  "is difficult to disagree with," Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said  on returning from the latest peace talks in Geneva, ITAR-TASS news agency  reported on Monday.
Kozyrev was referring to a statement by French counterpart Alain Juppe  that withdrawal from the UN Protection Force was a possibility if the  bloodshed continued, "and it is difficult not to be in agreement with that,"  the minister told Russian journalists late Sunday.
The reaction of the belligerents to the latest settlement proposals were  "promising," since there "was at least no outright rejection," Kozyrev  remarked.
The minister said a "war of parliaments" would be highly undesirable. He  was referring to a vote by the US Senate to permit arms sales to Bosnia, and a  vote by the Duma here that the Russian government should ignore international  sanctions against rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).

Britain's output prices rose by 0.3 percent in  April from March, compared with a revised 0.2 percent in March, provisional,  seasonally-corrected figures from the central statistical office (CSO) showed  Monday.
Over the year to the end of April, output prices rose 2.2 percent -- the  lowest annual increase since December 1986 -- compared to a revised figure of  2.8 percent for the year to the end of March.
The figures were better than analysts' forecasts of a monthly rise of 0.3  percent and an annual rise of 2.2 percent.
A Treasury spokesman said the figures showed "further evidence of weak  inflationary pressures."
Input prices rose by 0.4 percent in April, from a revised figure of 0.1  percent in March.
Over the year to the end of April, input prices fell 1.5 percent after  dropping a revised 2.8 percent in the year to the end of March.
Excluding food, drink, tobacco and oil products, output prices rose by 0.2  percent last month and by 2.2 percent on the year -- the lowest annual rise  since April 1993, the CSO said.

Italy's police chief Vincenzo Parisi has banned  demonstrations by skinheads nationwide following a weekend protest march in  the northeastern town of Vicenza, the interior ministry said Monday.
Some 300 skinheads, or right-wing extremists, marched through the streets  of Vicenza for the first time Saturday chanting racist slogans, and wearing  black shirts bearing swastikas.
The demonstration had not been banned by authorities although they kept a  close watch on the demonstrators.
The Jewish communisty in the region sent a telegram to President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro over the weekend denouncing the march.

Northern forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh  aim to blockade the southern bastion of Aden but not capture it, Yemeni  Foreign Minister Mohammad Bassandawa said Monday.
"The priority is not to capture Aden but to put it under blockade, by  controlling its entries and surrounding heights," Bassandawa, a northerner  loyal to the president, told the Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq.
The northern army would not try to capture Aden, a stronghold of Vice  President Ali Salem al-Baid, to "save human lives and vital economic  facilities" in the southern port city.
"Toppling the separatist clique within the Yemeni Socialist Party" of Baid  "is the responsibility of the people, the leaders and the unionist militants  of the YSP and their armed forces," Bassandawa said.
His comments came as Saleh's forces, fighting an all-out war against  Baid's since May 5, were reported Sunday to be advancing on Aden.
Bassandawa repeated that Baid and his followers should be brought to court  "for plotting against the unity" of Yemen.
North and South Yemen merged into a single state four years ago.
He reiterated the north's rejection of an Arab military intervention to  stop the fighting, saying this would mean a "recognition of an entity led by  the rebels."

The British brewery Whitbread on Monday announced a  32 percent hike in annual pre-tax profits at 234 million pounds (351 million  dollars) compared with 177 million pounds in 1992.
The results, for the year to Feburary 26, were slightly poorer than  analysts' expectations of between 238 and 242.5 million pounds.
The group, which also owns the restaurant chains Brewers Fayre, Beefeater,  Pizza Hut and Angus, lifted two percent to 2.36 billion pounds, compared with  2.32 billion pounds the previous years.
Earnings per share rose to 34.39 pence from 31.54 in 1992, while the  dividend rose to 18.8 pence from 17.75 pence.
Shares on the London Stock Exchange fell two pence to 570.

Machinery orders received by Japanese companies from  overseas in fiscal year to March jumped 13.9 percent from the preceding year  to 1.52 trillion yen (14.5 billion dollars), an industry association said  Monday.
Orders for power and chemical plants to Asian and Middle East countries  contributed to the increase, the Japan Industrial Machinery Association said.
The association said that machinery orders received by Japanese companies  in the 1993-94 fiscal year fell 1.8 percent to 4.75 trillion yen for the  second consecutive drop.
It attributed the decrease to a fall in earnings by companies amid the  economic slump hitting the country.
Orders from the Japanese motor vehicle industry in 1993-94 nose-dived 47.1  percent, while those from the local steel industry fell 27.9 percent, the  association said.
Machinery orders received by foreign and Japaenese companies in the fiscal  year rose 1.6 percent from 1992-93 to 6.27 trillion yen, it said.

Foreign investors have committed 4.7 billion  dollars to projects in India since the doors were opened to them by a  liberalisation programme in August 1991, the government said Monday.
More than 80 percent of the funds were pledged to "priority industries,"  the fuel and the oil refining sector topping the list followed by power  generation, food processing and metallargical industries.
Actual investment between August 1991 and March 1994, which marked the end  of the last financial year, amounted to a modest 1.1 billion dollars, a  government statement said.
US companies pumped in 218 million dollars of that sum, followed by  British and German companies with 153 million dollars and 78 million dollars  respectively.
The government has previously attributed the large gap between funds  committed by foreign investors and actual inflows to a long gestation period  required for projects in high-tech, capital-intensive areas to materialise.
Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao launched the liberalisation  programme soon after coming to power in 1991, allowing a majority shareholding  for foreign investors and easing investment and repatriation procedures.
The liberalisation overturned four decades of protectionism under which  foreign companies were shunned in the belief they would hurt domestic industry.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher held  talks Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara as the official press  called for a rapid Israeli pullout from the strategic Golan Heights.
A Western diplomat said Syria wanted an Israeli withdrawal to be completed  within three years while Israel is offering a five-to-eight year timetable,  starting with the return of three out of five Druze villages on the plateau.
Christopher, who was due to leave for Israel, met Shara for one hour but  no details emerged.
The US envoy had four hours of talks with President Hafez al-Assad on  Sunday, in the second meeting between the two men in as many weeks.
He was originally scheduled to leave Damascus late Monday after further  talks, but a US official said he had covered "all the topics he wanted to  discuss" and would be leaving for Israel sooner than expected.
The government Tishrin newspaper said that the success of Christopher's  mission depended on an "immediate Israeli withdrawal from the Golan according  to a well defined timetable.
Tishrin on Sunday said Syria was willing to negotiate an Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan on condition Israel pledged a complete pullout  within an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe.
Christopher was expected to deliver Israel's response to Assad's  counter-proposals, following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal  from the Golan.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five-eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
Syria rejected the offer and was likely to turn down Israeli proposals  that Christopher try to persuade Damascus to set up a joint military  commission with Israel to "draft security arrangements" for the heights.

Hours after returning from Rwanda, former  Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser urged Canberra Monday to exercise  caution in deciding whether to send troops to the war-ravaged Central African  state.
Fraser's comments came as the government considered a UN request for an  Australian contingent of up to 400 troops as part of an international force to  protect refugees from the tribal genocide that has already claimed an  estimated 200,000 lives.
Speaking at a news conference here, Fraser said Foreign Minister Gareth  Evans should "pay attention to the political and diplomatic side".
Troops should only be sent if the warring factions agreed to a UN force  and such a force should have as its special envoy someone of "adequate  stature", he said.
"If Australia or other governments are to consider sending in troops, I'm  just pleading with them to pay attention to the political and diplomatic side,  without which no real reconciliation will emerge," said Fraser, who was prime  minister from 1975 to 1983.
"What is the point of a military venture unless you are looking after the  politics? It's the politics that have led to the slaughter."
Meanwhile, senior officials from departments such as defence and foreign  affairs met in Canberra to discuss the UN request.
Officials said Australia shared US concerns over a peace enforcement  mission in Rwanda, where fighting between government and rebel forces shows no  sign of abating, and massacres are still being reported.
A vote by the UN Security Council on the composition of a peace-keeping  force for Rwanda is not expected before early Tuesday Australian time (Monday  afternoon GMT).
Although Evans has said Australia would "very sympathetically" consider a  UN request, officials stressed the situation was being treated cautiously.
Fraser also spoke to Evans after visiting the world's largest refugee camp  on the border of Rwanda and Tanzania, where aid organisations are trying to  cope with more than 300,000 refugees from the horrors of Rwanda.

Freight and passenger traffic both rose, pushing turnover up 2.9 percent  to 17.7 billion marks for the carrier, in which the Bonn government hopes soon  to sell its majority stake.

Three pieces of heavy weaponry have been sighted  by UN military observers in a Serb-controlled neighborhood in Sarajevo, UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday.
The location of the weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon  -- is in violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone  around Sarajevo.
UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the two mortar guns were sighted Sunday  in Grbavica, a neighborhood overlooking the capital.
Another UN military source who requested anonymity said the anti-aircraft  gun was also found in the same neighborhood which is under the control of  Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbs earlier this month managed to sneak a tank into the region.
The tank, a T-34, disappeared while being transported on a truck from  Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale in violation of the exclusion zone barring  heavy weaponry around Sarajevo.

China is a foreign policy priority for Moscow,  although domestic differences exist on the approach to certain China-related  issues, a senior Russian parliamentarian said here Monday.
Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian parliament's lower house emphasised  the importance Moscow attaches to Sino-Russian ties, but added that some  deputies had opposing views on the questions of border visas and applying the  Chinese economic model in Russia.
Many Russian deputies are believed to be in favour of visa restrictions to  stem the flood of people crossing the Sino-Russian border daily.
Some 2.5 million people crossed the border last year and Moscow has  expressed concern over the number of Chinese in Russia.
While Rybkin praised China's economic success, he stressed that Russia  could not always follow the same path, especially as it did not have the  support of a similarly wealthy overseas community.
Rybkin, who is heading an 11-member parliamentary delegation, met Monday  with President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Li Lanqing, with whom he discussed  the planned visit to China later this month of Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.
After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning of the 1960s,  the two communist giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China  by Mikhail Gorbachev.
Since Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 following the  collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing have enjoyed close military  cooperation.
Rybkin also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to participate in  several large-scale construction projects in China, including the massive  Three Gorges hydro-electric dam being built on the Yangtze River.

The first of five state bank executives accused of  corruption over a 430 million dollar credit fraud went on trial in Jakarta on  Monday facing a life jail term if found guilty.
South Jakarta court prosecutor Mohamad Yamin said Maman Suparman, a  48-year-old former deputy branch director of the Indonesian Development Bank  (Bapindo), unlawfully converted an irrevocable letter of credit.
The conversion, done without the knowledge of the bank management and  board, was for ethnic Chinese businessman Eddy Tansil. The former tycoon is on  trial separately. The state is said to have suffered losses of 175 million  dollars.
An irrevocable letter of credit normally becomes payable when goods have  been supplied. But the money can be drawn in certain circumstances before  goods have been delivered.
Between 1989 and 1991, Tansil sought and obtained 430 million dollars in  credit from Bapindo for the construction of chemical facilities by his Golden  Key Group, the court heard. The money was never paid back.
The prosecutor also charged that Suparman, deputy director of Bapindo  branches in Bandung, Surabaya and Jakarta, received bribes from clients,  including Eddy Tansil, totalling 562 million rupiah (261,152 dollars).
It took the prosecutor two hours to read a 36-page accusation to the  heavily guarded court room to a panel of judges headed by Sujatman. Hundreds  of people followed the trial through loudspeakers outside the building.
The trial was adjourned until Thursday to hear the defence reply to the  charges from Suparman's lawyer Denny Kailimang.
Kailimang also asked the judge to release the defendant on bail.
Despite a letter of objection from Kailimang, the attorney general office,  which arrested Suparman in February, has insisted on detaining Suparman,  saying he might lose evidence, disappear or repeat the wrongdoings.
Kailimang said all evidence had been confiscated by the court and that  Suparman could not go abroad as he was on an immigration blacklist. A  conditional release would help prepare a better defence, the lawyer said.
The other four suspects slated for trial were all top Bapindo executives,  accused of issuing credit to Tansil despite insufficient colateral and without  carrying out proper checks.

Hong Kong's major domestic export items of  clothing, textiles, and consumer electrical and electronic products suffered  declines in the first quarter of the year, despite accounting for 52 percent  of the total domestic exports, official figures showed Monday.
Domestic exports of clothing and textiles fell five percent in the three  months to March from a year earlier to 8.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.05  billion US) and 7.9 billion dollars respectively, the Census and Statistics  Department said.
Consumer electrical and electronic products dropped by 20 percent to 6.9  billion dollars, it said.
For the first quarter of this year, exports of clothing, textiles and  consumer electrical and electronic products accounted for 52 percent of the  territory's total domestic exports of 44.74 billion dollars.
However, increases were recorded in the Janaury and March period in  machinery, parts and compenents, which rose four percent to 232 million  dollars.
Exports of non-metallic mineral products rose 98 percent to 103 million  dollars, food was up 11 percent at 54 million dollars.
Hong Kong's domestic exports have gradually declined as manufacturers  continue to shift production into China.
As a result, Hong Kong's exports have undergone structural shift from  domestic exports to re-exports, being China's main entrepot.

An explosion at an arms depot in the Russian Far  East blew up 1,600 tonnes of missiles, mines and shells, local administration  chief Yevgeni Nazdratenko said in Vladivostok on Monday.
The blast on Saturday 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Vladivostok spread  over a 10-kilometres (six miles) radius where villages had to be evacuated, he  said, ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
The remaining weapons at the Pacific fleet depot were being made safe  before being deliberately destroyed, and the arms dump would not be rebuilt,  Nazdratenko said. The cause of the blast was not immediately known.

Defence officials from Armenia and Azerbaijan began  consultations here on Monday about the embattled Nagorno-Karabakh enclave  under Russian mediation, in a new bid to set up official negotiations for a  peace settlement.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov said  the idea was to bring the parties together and arrange for formal talks to  reach a final agreement covering an overall ceasefire, withdrawal of troops  and the stationing of a peace force from the Commonwealth of Independent  States accompanied by international observers.
Russia and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe have been  trying since February to get Armenia and Azerbaijan to accept the package.
Kazimirov and the CSCE's Swedish envoy Jan Eliasson spent last week in the  two countries and in the enclave, which is Azerbaijani territory but under  Armenian control. More than 20,000 people have been killed in six years of  fighting.

German air carrier Lufthansa revealed  net consolidated losses of 92 million marks (55.42 million dollars) for 1993  on Monday after a 391 million deficit for 1992.
Freight and passenger traffic both rose, pushing turnover up 2.9 percent  to 17.7 billion marks for the carrier, in which the Bonn government hopes soon  to sell its majority stake.

Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Monday Japan may  help US forces take action against North Korea's refusal to allow full  international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
"Generally speaking, cooperation with US activities will be made within  the limits of the constitution under any circumstances," Hata told the House  of Councillors.
Hata was replying after an opposition lawmaker asked if Japan would assist  any US military action in the Korean nuclear crisis, in addition to helping  impose any UN sanctions against the hardline communist state.
Japan's pacifist post-World War II constitution bars the use of force in  settling international disputes, effectively preventing Japanese troops from  joining UN peace-keeping combat missions.
But members of Hata's three-week-old cabinet have suggested new  legislation to expand Japan's emergency activities, including logistical  support for US forces in actions such as a naval blockade.

The main pilots' union here called on Russia's  40,000 pilots to observe a general strike from Wednesday to protest at  deteriorating safety standards and poor retirement benefits, the union's  leader said Monday.
Eduard Bychkov said the union had asked the government during its congress  in February to deal with its demands by May 18 or face a nationwide unlimited  strike.
The transport ministry, which has forwarded the pilots' demands to  parliament, is hoping to negotiate a last-minute deal to avert the strike, the  ministry's press office said.
The pilots plan to demonstrate in front of the parliament building Tuesday.
"As pilots responsible for safety, we have come to the limit of what is  acceptable," Valentin Presnyakov, a pilot, was quoted as saying in the Moscow  Times. "If things continue to deteriorate, we will personally be afraid to  fly."
Air crashes have been on the rise here since the demise of the Soviet  Union, and western experts have noted deteriorating safety procedures at  Aeroflot and other airlines now operating in the former Soviet Union.
The latest crash was on March 23 when an airliner came down in Siberia  killing 75 people.
Several transport officials have said that flight recorders showed that  the pilot's son had been at the plane's controls when it crashed.

The dollar firmed against the main European  currencies early on Monday before a meeting of the US Federal Reserve's  policy-making Open Markets Committee on Tuesday which is thought likely to  raise interest rates.
By mid morning, the dollar was being traded at 1.6765 marks from 1.6680 at  the close on Friday.
At Paribas Capital Markets analyst Richard Turnhill said that the dollar  was being supported by "encouraging US statistics last week showing inflation  remains under control, and on expectations of a 50-basis-point rise in the US  discount rate and the federal funds rate" which is the interest charged on  overnight interbank loans.
Dealers were also waiting for US industrial production figures for April  later in the day.
The dollar fell slightly against the yen to 104.75 yen from 104.85 at the  close in London.
Turnhill said that the yen remained fragile on "continuing signs of  weakness in the Japanese economy and signs that trade tensions might be easing  slightly", after Washington had announced on Friday the resumption of  US-Japanese trade discussions this week.
He added that the Bank of Japan had probably intervened overnight on the  Asian market to sell yen for dollars.
The strength of the dollar weighed on the mark which fell to 3.4295 French  francs from 3.4315 at the close on Friday  but remained stable at 958.8 lire.
The pound was firm after a 0.3 percent monthly rise in British output  prices in April, and an annual increase of 2.2 percent. This was the weakest  increase since December 1986.
By mid morning the pound was being traded at 1.5003 dollars from 1.4990 at  the close on Friday, at 2.5153 marks from 2.5003, at 157.23 yen from 157.17,  at 2.1457 Swiss francs from 2.1376, and at 8.6289 French francs from 8.5687.
The dollar was being quoted at 1.6765 marks from 1.6680, at 104.75 yen  from 104.85, at 1.4295 Swiss francs from 1.4260, and at 5.7488 French francs  from 5.7162.
In Paris, the dollar was also higher, while the mark remained unchanged  from the close on Friday at 3.4295 French francs. The market changed little  before the meeting of the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
The market was also expecting the Bank of France to cut its key interest  rates, to follow the 0.5 point cut in the Bundesbank's two key interest rates  -- the Lombard and the discount rate -- on Wednesday, said a trader.
By mid morning the mark was at 3.4295 French francs from 3.4300 at the  close on Friday.
The dollar was being traded at 5.7489 French francs from 5.7250 at the  close on Friday, at 1.6768 marks from 1.6695 and at 104.75 yen from 104.80.
The pound was sharply higher at 8.6231 French francs from 8.5806.

Northern Ireland police swooped on Protestant  loyalist hideouts in west and north Belfast early Monday, making a large but  unspecified number of arrests, sources said.
A police spokesman said the operation was continuing and would not comment:
An informed source said those held for questioning included a leader of  the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a main loyalist militia.
Protestant paramilitary groups have for some two years been held  responsible for more killings that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Ulster  and police say they the greatest current threat to security in the province.

The United Nations on Monday protested to rebels  accused of firing on an army-escorted convoy carrying a French former  humanitarian minister on a mercy mission to staunch Rwanda's ethnic bloodbath.
Bernard Kouchner, the flamboyant founder of the French medical agency  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors without Borders), was forced to dive  into a ditch for cover when a hail of bullets rained down on his convoy just  outside the embattled capital Kigali on Sunday, UN spokesman Moctar Gueye said.
Gueye was himself hit in the face by bullet fragments.
Kouchner was returning from a meeting in Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25  miles) to the south-west, with officials of the interim government proclaimed  after president Juvenal Habyarimana's death six weeks ago triggered frenzied  killings in which an estimated 200,000 people have been butchered.
Kouchner, who is working with the UN on his mission, had earlier held  talks with leaders of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), battling the  army for control of Kigali and now thought to control about two-thirds of  Rwanda, according to UN officials.
The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) protested over the attack to  the RPF, and also complained to the army which it blamed for "failing to  ensure Kouchner's security," said Gueye, speaking by telephone from Kigali.
Kouchner has spent five days in Rwanda trying to persuade both sides to  allow civilians trapped in the capital and still being massacred by death  squads to leave via "humanitarian safe corridors" which he wants the army and  rebels to agree to keep free from fighting.
So far there has been no sign of such an accord. But Gueye said the  mission was continuing and Kouchner, scheduled to leave Sunday, was still in  Kigali on Monday.
A lull in the artillery and mortar duels that have raged in Kigali for 10  days brought welcome quiet Monday morning, Gueye said.
Rain lashed the war-scarred city perched on hills once green with banana  trees but now brown and barren, stripped by hungry refugees from the central  African country's pitiless carnage.
"There were some exchanges of fire overnight but the battle lines are  still about the same," Gueye said. "Everyone's waiting."
Fierce fighting pitted the rebels, mainly minority Tutsis, against the  Hutu-led army Sunday in Kigali and several other towns including Ruhengeri in  the northwest and Bugesera, south of Kigali.
The rebels are advancing from east to west south of the capital towards  Gitarama, the refuge of the interim government which fled Kigali more than a  month ago.
Most of the 200,000 people slaughtered in Rwanda have been Tutsis and Hutu  opposition supporters rounded up and hacked to death by extremist Hutu  militiamen, according to relief officials and witnesses who have fled the  country.
Eleven UN peacekeepers have been killed, 10 of them Belgian soldiers  allegedly murdered by the presidential guard.
The UN security council is considering proposals by Secretary-General  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to strengthen its force in Rwanda by sending in 5,500  troops.
The UN withdrew all but 400 of its 2,500 peacekeepers from Rwanda after  they proved powerless to stem the tide of blood that engulfed the country last  month.
The world body seems reluctant to embark on a new perilous venture in  Africa after its failure to end Somalia's anarchy, diplomats said.

President Boris Yeltsin appointed Monday a regional  official from southern Russia to the key post of nationalities minister,  signalling the Kremlin's fresh resolve to defuse ethnic tension in the  troubled northern Caucasus region.
Nikolai Yegorov, 42, an ethnic Cossack who headed the regional  administration of Krasnodar, replaced Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister  who also held the nationalities portfolio, the presidential press service said.
Shakhrai will retain the rank of deputy prime minister and the regional  policy portfolio.
The appointment came after Shakhrai failed in consecutive rounds of  negotiations to restore relations with the breakaway republic of Chechnya  which declared independence from Moscow in 1991.
Attempts at resolving the conflict between ethnic Ingush and Ossetians in  the Caucasus republic of North Ossetia have also failed to yield results  following a brief outbreak of fighting in the fall of 1992.
As governor of the Krasnodar region, Yegorov has managed to maintain  stability in a multi-ethnic region bordering Russia's trouble spots in the  Northern Caucasus, the ITAR-TASS news agency said.
"He enjoys considerable authority, not only in that territory, but also  among the leaders of Russia's northern Caucasus republics," the news agency  said.
The Krasnodar region has been hard hit by a flow of refugees from the  northern Caucasus -- a diverse region made up of dozens of ethnic groups and  clans -- and also from the west Georgian province of Abkhazia.
The pro-reform newspaper Sevodnya reported last week that the imminent  appointment of Yegorov signalled a strengthening of regional political elites  in Russia.
Yegorov's appointment came after a five-hour meeting with Yeltsin two  months ago during which the two men discussed Russian migration from former  Soviet republics and ethnic problems in the northern Caucasus.
The Kremlin views ethnic tension in the northern Caucasus as a potentially  explosive situation and has imposed a state of emergency in several regions to  prevent a slide towards civil war.
In his negotiations with the rebel Chechen leadership, Shakhrai pressed for  early elections to the presidency of the republic, a stand which offended  local leaders who demanded Shakhrai's resignation as a condition for holding  settlement talks.
Chechen leader Djokhar Dudayev has refused to sign the federation treaty,  which defines Russia's component territories and has virtually ignored all  decisions emanating from Moscow.
In North Ossetia, thousands of Ingush refugees have yet to return to their  homes following ethnic fighting in the fall of 1992 sparked by Ingush demands  for the annexation of part of North Ossetia to nearby Ingushetia.
Ethnic Ingush claim that the Prigorodny region of North Ossetia is part of  their historic homeland which was partitioned under Stalin in 1944.

Two researchers were badly hurt in an explosion at  Russia's nuclear centre at Sneyinsk (formerly Chelyabinsk-70) in the Urals,  ITAR-TASS quoted the site's deputy director as saying Monday.
The explosion occurred last Friday during an attempt to bring  decommissioned oil wells back on stream, but was said not to have caused any  radioactive leak.
Ten grams of an unidentified chemical substance exploded, injuring the two  researchers, whose lives were not believed to be in danger.
The centre's vice-director said the accident happened well away from the  site's nuclear reactors and the machinery concerned did not contain any  radioactive substances.

Three pieces of heavy weaponry have been sighted  by UN military observers in a Serb-controlled neighborhood overlooking  Sarajevo, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday.
The location of the weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon  -- is in violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone  barring heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital.
UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the two mortar guns were spotted Sunday  in Grbavica. Another UN military source who requested anonymity said the  anti-aircraft gun was also found in the same neighborhood.
Annink said negotiations were underway to transport the weapons to a  collection center.
But the military source said that the Serbs were refusing to budge by  claiming that the weapons had been neutralized.
He said that claim was baseless as the Serbs had only removed the firing  pins "which could be reinstalled in two minutes."
The weekend discovery of the weapons was the latest in a series of  violations of the exclusion zone and a ceasefire agreed in February by  Bosnia's warring factions under the threat of NATO air strikes.
The Serbs earlier this month managed to sneak a tank into Grbavica.
The tank, a T-34, disappeared while being transported on a truck from  Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale.
UN peacekeepers have also increasingly come under fire, the latest such  incident occuring Sunday when a convoy was targeted in the Mount Igman region,  located about 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Sarajevo.
Annink said that the mostly Moslem Bosnian army was responsible for the  attack but he did not elaborate. He added that UNPROFOR convoys were  encountering increasing problems in southern Bosnia.
He said about 50 civilians, mainly women, have blocked part of the road  linking the Croatian town of Split with the central Bosnian town of Zenica  since this weekend. The women, he said, are demanding to know the wherabouts  of their husbands who have gone missing and want the UN to pay them a fee for  the convoys.

About 50 members of an organization made up of the  mothers of soldiers who have died during their military service demonstrated  in central Moscow Monday to denounce "inhuman conditions" in the armed froces.
The organization, which has a membership of 10,000, said it would maintain   its protest campaign until June 15, the deadline for spring military  conscripts.
Students, who have so far been exempt from military service until the end  of their studies, are expected to be forced to fulfill their obligation this  year.
The mothers of soldiers have repeatedly asked the government to  investigate the deaths of several conscripts and want an increase in benefits  paid to their families. They are also seeking to abolish the mandatory service  or otherwise want the minimum 18-year-old age of conscripts to be raised.
"I am well aware of our movement's weakness up against the powerful  military-industrial sector but we no longer want to sacrifice our sons," said  Lubov Lymar, the head of the movement.
Members plan to demonstrate next week in front of the parliament building.  They have vowed to go on hunger strike unless the government responds to their  demands.

South Africa's new President Nelson Mandela  has strongly denied a London press report that he plans to retire in two  years' time.
In a weekend statement released by his African National Congress, Mandela,  who was sworn in as the country's first black head of state on May 10, said  the report in the Sunday Times was "rumour-mongering written with the  intention to create uncertainty."
"The poeple of South Africa have given the president a mandate and he  intends to fulfil that mandate," said Mandela, 75, terming the article  "totally unfounded and malicious disinformation."
The newspaper quoted ANC sources as saying Mandela has "privately hinted  he will step down once a final constitution has been written and he has  overseen the country's first steps toward reconciliation."
Manela's "determination to give up power well ahead of the next general  election has sparked a power struggle" within the ANC, it said.
The parliament that emerged from the country's first democratic election  on April 26-29 is mandated to rewrite the nation's final constitution over the  next five years.
South Africa is in the meantime run by an interim constitution that went  into effect at midnight on April 26, the start of the second day of the  historic poll.

Share prices rose in early trading here on Monday,  boosted by a rally in the futures market and encouraging output statistics for  April, dealers said.
On the first day of a new account in London, the FT-SE 100 index of  leading shares rose by 10.6 points to 3,129.8 by mid morning for an increase  of 0.3 percent. In Paris, the CAC-40 index rose by 0.58 percent.
British output prices rose by 0.3 percent in April from March, with an  annual rise of 2.2 percent. This was the lowest annual increase since December  1986.
Dealers said that share prices showed limited rises as many companies were  going ex-dividend. Thus the price of shares in British Gas fell by 11 pence to  290.5, while Sears fell by 2.5 pence to 123 and the Royal Bank of Scotland  dipped two pence to 430.
Eurotunnel dipped two pence to 430 after announcing the start of its  freight services on May 19, forecasting a first dividend payment in 2003, and  announcing new traffic forecasts which were slightly down on previous  forecasts.
Whitbread was unchanged at 572 pence after announcing a 32 percent  increase in annual pre-tax profits to 234 million pounds (350 million dollars).
British Airways firmed one pence to 392 after reaching agreement on its  planned flights from London to Paris' Orly airport.
In Paris, shares were higher as the market appeared less worried about a  potential rise in US interest rates at the meeting of the Federal Reserve  policy-making Open Markets Committee.
Any eventual rise, forecast to be around 50 basis points, in US interest  rates on Tuesday was "looked at with increasing serenity" by the markets, said  one dealer. "If such a rise takes place, we believe it will be the last."
Futures were higher in Paris, gaining 0.42 percent to 120.60.
Among those rising, l'Oreal rose by 1.43 percent, while Generale des Eaux  rose by 1.89 percent after announcing profits of 3.2 billion francs for 1993.
UAP dropped 0.96 percent, while Eurotunnel was down by 1.46 percent.

Moscow's provisional budget allocation for Russia's  strategic nuclear forces only covers 10 percent of the total sum required,  ITAR-TASS quoted military experts as saying Monday.
The military has for weeks been campaigning for a greater net allocation  of budget funds.
The head of the defence ministry's finance section, General Vasily  Vorobiov, said the provisional military share was "insufficient to pay arms  producers and to continue to finance scientific projects in strategic fields."
The 1994 budget adopted by deputies on the bill's first reading in  parliament last week foresees 37,000 billion roubles (20 billion dollars), or  almost 20 percent of total expenditure, for military purposes. But Vorobiov  believes this figure will "not guarantee the survival of the Russian army."
Military officials are demanding at least 55,000 billion roubles, a sum  Finance Minister Yuri Dubinin has called simply "unrealistic".

The Bank of Greece increased its overdraft rate for  banks by three points to 33 percent on Monday, the bank said in a statement  against a background of pressure against the currency.
The bank said that it would charge an additional 0.4 points per day and  that it was increasing its re-discount rate from 21.5 percent to 22.5 percent  and its Lombard rate for some operations from 25.5 percent to 26.5 percent.
The reference rate on the interbank market had risen to 75 percent early  on Monday. Market sources said that this had been engineered by the big  nationalised banks which had acted on discreet instructions from the central  bank.
On Friday the interbank rate had been 23 percent. The governor of the  central bank, Ionnis Boutos, has said that he was determined to use interest  rates to defend the currency.
Speculation against the drachma emerged suddenly last week. On Saturday  the socialist government surprised markets by deciding to bring forward by six  weeks to Monday the total liberation of capital flows.
The head of the foreign exchange department at Citibank in Greece said  that the money market was extremely nervous and that the authorities were  trying to discourage a battle over the currency.
When trading began on Monday the drachma was steady at 147.80 to the mark  compared with 147.70 at the close on Friday.
The government said during the weekend that it would not devalue the  drachma which is the only currency within the European union which has never  joined the European monetary system (EMS). Greek and foreign banks have argued  that the currency is over valued by 10 percent to 30 percent.
One European expert said: "But it can count only on interest rates and the  sanction of market will not wait." He held that the currency would probably be  devalued in the short term, but the Citibank expert held that it would not be  devalued before the elections to the European parliament in June.
Dealers here said that last week the central bank had had to spend about  one billion dollars to support the drachma but that its reserves amounted to  only nine billion dollars.
This explained why the government had acted urgently in an attenpt to  impress the markets by advancing the liberalisation of capital flows.

At least 500 police, army and border guards  Monday scrambled to track a pet Indian python, identified as a potential  strangler, MTI news agency said.
More than three metres (yards) long and seven centimetres (almost three  inches) thick, the snake escaped from its owner's flat Sunday in southern  Zalaegerszeg.
The owner, a 39-year-old electrician, said the animal was not venomous but  could strangle anyone trying to capture it. Experts fom Budapest Zoo said its  recovery was a question of luck as it had left no trail.

European Union foreign ministers meeting here  Monday were trying to reinforce a shaky new US-Russian-EU initiative to end  the two-year civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The EU meeting followed agreement in Geneva on Saturday between the United  States, Russia and five EU countries -- France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and  Greece -- to push for a four-month ceasefire and new negotiations.
"We want to push the Geneva initiative," Spanish Foreign Minister Javier  Solana said as he entered the meeting.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the plan was just a "first  step" that still depended on its acceptance by the Serb, Moslem and Croat  forces battling for a bigger share of the former Yugoslavia republic.
Both Moslem and Serb leaders in Bosnia gave a chilly initial reception to  the initiative, which would give Moslems and Croats together 51 percent of  Bosnia, and the Serbs 49 percent, down from the 70 percent they currently hold.
The Moslems and Croats are claiming this is not enough. They want 58  percent, on the grounds that together the two groups make up 61 percent of the  population. And the Bosnian Serbs want to be left with more than 49 percent.
But Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev was quoted as saying in Moscow  on Monday that the reaction of the belligerants to the Geneva initiative was  "promising", since they had not rejected it outright.
The Geneva initiative is a critical effort to stop the Bosnian conflict  entering an even more dangerous phase after two years of fruitless EU and  Western attempts to end it.
France has threatened to withdraw its peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if  fighting continues there.
This could lead to the collapse of the United Nations humanitarian mission  in Bosnia and the world body's efforts to protect six "safe areas" of Moslem  concentration from being over-run by Serb forces.
Meanwhile, pressure has been building up in the United States in favour of  lifting an arms embargo in former Yugoslavia so that the balance of military  power would be tilted in favour of the Bosnian Moslems.
The US Senate voted last week for such a move which, if implemented, would  put the final nails in UN attempts to keep buffer forces in Bosnia.
And fighting between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems around the northern Bosnian  town of Tuzla has intensified in recent days, with each side accusing the  other of preparing an offensive.
Tuzla is one of four Bosnian towns under North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation protection. NATO decided last month to bomb any Serb heavy  weapons shelling these Moslem pockets.
There have also been suggestions that the NATO ultimatum should be  extended to a new Serb-Moslem flashpoint in the Bosnian conflict -- the Brcko  corridor in northern Bosnia which links Serbia to its conquests in western  Bosnia.
Failure of the Geneva initiative would put greater pressure on an  unwilling NATO to carry out its threats and deepen the west's military  involvement in the Bosnian civil war.
The European foreign ministers were also trying Monday to strengthen an EU  plan to take over the temporary administration of the southern Bosnian city of  Mostar.
Fighting between Croats and Moslems there has eased off over the past two  months as the two sides negotiated a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia,  brokered by the United States.
But an accord concerning details of a neutral EU administration of Mostar  has still not been reached because of what one diplomat here called "an  atmosphere of massive distrust" between Moslems and Croats there.

The French airline Air Liberty is to complain to the  commission of the European union to obtain equal treatment for all airlines at  London Heathrow and Paris Orly airports, the company said on Monday.
The company said that it planned to open four daily flights between Orly  and Heathrow from June 30.
The commission has instructed France to make Orly airport accessible to  British Airways and its French subsidiary TAT in a move which has caused  anxiety to the French state-owned Air France airline which is in severe  financial trouble.
International flights for foreign airlines are currently operated from  Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris, and the French authorities fear that  access for foreign airlines to Orly, south of Paris, will increase competition  on flights to the south of France.
During the weekend French and British authorities reached a compromise.  Orly is to be opened to British Airways from the end of June and French  airlins are to have greater access to Heathrow.

An artist who snipped off his pubic hair in  public to protest press coverage of Singapore's gay community pleaded guilty  Monday to obscenity.
Josef Ng Sing Chor faces up to three months jail and a fine of 2,000  Singapore dollars (1,290 US) or both when he comes up for sentencing before a  judge Tuesday.
Ng, a 22-year-old navy sergeant, triggered calls for tighter government  supervision over the performance arts, by turning his back on shoppers in a  crowded mall, dropping his briefs and cutting his pubic hair.
The New Year's eve performance was promptly condemned by Singapore's  National Arts Council which called the act "vulgar and completely  distasteful."    The council and police also barred Ng and another performer  who forced himself to vomit before the same audience from performing in public  again.
"I was making a statement. I did it for the sake of my art," Ng said  before pleading guilty.
